# Translation: upstream engine gaps

Both mods use only the public `gen1recomp` content and hook APIs. Each game's section (RBY, then Gold) tracks these kinds of entries:

- **Required upstream capabilities**: strings that render in English with no
  override reaching them at all -- no hook, no catalog entry can fix these
  from the translation mod; they must not be implemented by reaching into
  private UI classes.
- **Translated via a compromise (`engine-contract-gap`)**: strings that
  already render translated today, but through a compromise (an
  AI-generated stand-in, a reordered-argument adaptation, or one override
  serving several incompatible original contexts) instead of the real
  official localized phrasing, because the engine's callsite doesn't map
  cleanly onto it. These are not broken, but the goal is to retire this
  category over time as gen1recomp's contract at each callsite is fixed.
- **Fixed upstream**: a former "Required upstream capabilities" entry,
  closed either by wiring this project's own config to an already-public
  hook (Gold's "Fixed: rows already reachable..." section), or by a
  gen1recomp engine change (both games' "Fixed upstream" sections).
- **In progress**: fixes implemented and verified against a real build --
  whether still on a local branch, opened as a PR, or already merged
  upstream -- kept here until this project's pinned `gen1recomp_revision`
  catches up to a revision that contains them (RBY only for now).
- **Verified working, not a gap**: something that looked like a gap on
  inspection but turned out to already render correctly once checked
  against a real build -- kept here so the same question does not get
  re-investigated later.

Two standalone kinds of report close the file, kept separate because they
are not translation gaps at all: gen1recomp rendering bugs surfaced by TTF
mode (both fixed), and `tools/modkit.py` Windows-encoding bugs hit while
running or validating a mod (one fixed, one still open with a
project-side workaround only).

## RBY

### Verified working, not a gap

The SummaryMenu's own stat labels (`NAME`, `ATTACK`, `DEFENSE`, `SPEED`,
`SPECIAL`) are **not** blocked, despite each needing a `forced_dynamic_keys`
entry in `config/shared/engine_manifest.json` to be reachable at all: the
callsite (`ui/SummaryMenu.lua:150-157`) reads them from a runtime table
(`Strings(s[1])`), which a static literal scanner cannot see, so they must be
force-added to the catalog by key -- but `Strings()` itself is an ordinary
runtime lookup by string value, indifferent to whether the call site used a
literal or a variable. `config/rby/semantic_anchors.json` already carries a
working anchor for all five (`rb.stat_names.VitaminStats.2-5`,
`rb.start_sub_menus.TrainerInfo_NameMoneyTimeText`), confirmed translated
(`fr`: `FOR`/`DEF`/`VIT`/`SPE`/`NOM`) in a real build's generated
`strings.lua`. (A prior version of this README's "Remaining limitations"
listed these as English-only; that was stale.)

If a future gen1recomp version rewrote this callsite to pass a literal
(`Strings("ATTACK")` per case instead of `Strings(s[1])`), the scanner would
discover it on its own and `forced_dynamic_keys` would no longer be needed
to make the key reachable -- and the anchors themselves would likely become
redundant too, not just the manual catalog entry. Two things confirm this
rather than just the scanner gap: `corpus_to_engine("ATTACK@")` already
strips the trailing `@` down to plain `"ATTACK"`, the same normalization
ordinary aligned records get before exact/normalized auto-matching runs;
and although `ATTACK@` appears at two RedBlue qids
(`rb.stat_names.VitaminStats.2` and `rb.stat_mod_names.StatModTextStrings.0`),
both carry the identical translation in every shipped language (`fr`: `FOR`
for both), so the duplicate would not make an automatic match unsafe. The
anchors would stay harmless to keep either way -- explicit anchors still
win over auto-matching in the resolution order -- but the manual upkeep
they represent could be dropped.

Yellow's Melanie's House dialogue (`MelanieText1-5`, `MelanieBulbasaurText`,
`MelanieOddishText`, `MelanieSandshrewText`) looked like the same "extractor
skips labels without a leading underscore" gap as several RBY sites
investigated below, since those labels don't have one either. It isn't a
gap: `tools/make_yellow_manifest.py`'s `YELLOW_EXTRA_TEXT_LABELS` already
force-includes all eight into the Yellow manifest, and a real built
`dialogue_yellow.lua` already carries correct French translations for
them. (A prior version of this doc listed this as still open; that was
stale.)

Poison/burn's two `Strings.source()` literals (`_HurtByPoisonText`/
`_HurtByBurnText`'s defensive fallback in `damageOverTime()`) were
reclassified from `engine-contract-gap` (a translated-but-compromise
override) to `covered-by-rom` in `config/rby/engine_scope.json`'s
`key_scope_overrides`: the fallback only ever renders if those ROM labels
are missing from `data.text`, which they aren't in any real RB or Yellow
build, so the AI-translated override was dead code with nothing upstream
to wait on. Same shape as 15 other `covered-by-rom` keys already
classified this way (`_OakSpeechText2A`, `"Welcome to our\nPOKéMON
CENTER!"`, etc.) -- not written up individually here.

**Reading `game.data.text` directly, not through `Strings()`, is not a
gap.** A prior version of this doc claimed the opposite for a set of
flavor NPCs, covering 6 `literal_handlers.json` handlers and a "no public
API to give a Pokémon" blocker on Mt. Moon's Magikarp salesman. That did
not hold: `src/core/Strings.lua`'s own header explains extracted dialogue
(`Data.text`) has its own override path, `mod.content.text:override(id,
value)`, independent of `Strings()`/`mod.content.strings` -- so a script
reading `t[label]` is translatable regardless of whether it goes through
`Strings()` first. Confirmed directly against a real build's
`lang/dialogue.lua`: the Bike Shop's three NPCs and Route 24's
Nugget-Bridge recruiter were already reading `game.data.text` correctly,
with translations already present, via gen1recomp's own vanilla scripts
(`data/scripts/story2.lua`, `story4.lua`,
`data/scripts/flavor/bike_shop.lua`) -- which are also *more* complete
than this project's former reimplementations (real bag-capacity checks
via a `require` unrestricted for core engine code). Those 4 redundant
handlers were removed from `config/rby/literal_handlers.json`; letting
vanilla run is simpler and more correct. The same real-build check was
repeated for every other flavor NPC reading `game.data.text` this way --
Viridian City's `GAMBLER1`/`GIRL`, Pewter City's `SUPER_NERD1`/
`SUPER_NERD2`, the 8-NPC `gift()` family in `data/scripts/story5.lua`,
and Mt. Moon's Magikarp salesman (which also already calls
`give_pokemon` natively, so "no public API to give a Pokémon" was never
actually a blocker here) -- all confirmed already correctly translated,
no config needed. The Pokédex "kind" classification
(`src/ui/DexEntryMenu.lua:93`) looked like the same deep gap as the
status-ailment abbreviations above, but isn't: `pipeline/mod.py` already
has a dedicated `species_kinds` catalog for it. Viridian City's second
Youngster was the one genuine exception -- two of its three lines had no
reachable label at all until `fix/text-extractor-underscore-requirement`
(see "Fixed upstream" below), so it briefly needed its own
`map_scripts:register` reimplementation. That handler has since been
removed too: `config/rby/literal_handlers.json` now has 0 handlers, and
this project's pin includes the fix as of v0.2.19, so a normal pinned
build shows this NPC's real French text without any workaround.

### Fixed upstream (engine changes, not just this project's config)

- **Stat-rise messages:** the X-item/vitamin `"rose!"` messages
  substituted the raised stat's name as a raw Lua string, bypassing
  `Strings()`. Fixed on gen1recomp `fix/stat-rise-message-translation`
  (merged, PR #1439); the same bug was also fixed in `battle/TrainerAI.lua`
  and, Gold-side, in two `battle/gen2/Battle.lua` messages (see Gold
  below).
- **Museum 1F's ticket clerk:** three of `museumClerk`'s five lines were
  bare English literals, never routed through `game.data.text`. Fixed on
  gen1recomp `fix/museum-1f-ticket-clerk-strings` (merged, PR #1492).
  `config/rby/literal_handlers.json`'s `museum-1f-ticket-clerk` workaround
  has been removed -- vanilla handles all five lines correctly on its own.
- **Status condition abbreviations:** `PSN`/`PAR`/`BRN`/`FRZ`/`SLP` always rendered in English on the summary and party screens (`ui/SummaryMenu.lua:148`, `ui/PartyMenu.lua:824`), never passed through anything translatable. Fixed on gen1recomp `fix/status-abbreviation-translation` (merged, PR #1527). Not through `Strings()`, though: a status abbreviation is translated through the separate `statuses` content registry (`mod.content.statuses:patch(id, { label = value })`), the same one `BattleState.lua`'s in-combat status HUD already reads. This project's existing `status_labels` catalog was already patching it correctly before the merge -- it was just aimed at a callsite that ignored it, so nothing needed to change on this project's side once the fix landed. The same PR also fixed a second, independent bug: `Status.RECORDS`' five vanilla entries duplicated `hudLabel = label` for no reason, and the lookup reads `hudLabel` before `label` -- so even after the callsite fix, this project's `{ label = value }`-only patch was silently shadowed by the untouched vanilla `hudLabel` on every status. Confirmed live before the fix: SLP/BRN/FRZ stayed English, PSN/PAR only looked fine because French keeps the same three letters there. Both fixes shipped together; nothing to patch differently on this project's side.

### Fixed upstream: more battle/overworld/menu messages now routed through the real ROM text

gen1recomp `fix/route-more-messages-through-romtext` (merged upstream as PR #1559, included in gen1recomp release v0.2.12; this project's pin now includes it as of v0.2.19). 21 real ROM labels that only ever had a `Strings()` call with an adapted/approximate source now call `romText()`/`self:romText()` with their real extracted ROM label instead, so they show the corpus's official localized phrasing rather than the AI-adapted compromise. `tests/engine/` gained 7 new regression tests, one per message family, each driving the real interactive flow (or faking `Game`/`TextBox` via `debug.setupvalue` where there's no state to drive directly) and asserting the routed text. Manually verified in-game (French mod, Windows build) for 9 of 11 distinct scenarios, comparing `dev` against the branch side by side -- the slot machine's 3-symbol match and a link battle were left uncovered live (both awkward to trigger on demand), relying instead on the automated/static checks. This live pass caught one real bug the automated tests missed (see `_ItemUseBallText00` below), now fixed on the same branch. The rows below name what each fixed call site retires from the compromise table below -- **not yet re-audited against the bumped pin**: several are explicitly partial (a row shared with another, untouched call site only loses one of its collapsed contexts), so the compromise table itself is left untouched here rather than edited without the same live-build verification the rest of this doc relies on:

- `_PlayerBlackedOutText2` (`BattleState:enter()`): merges the two-line
  black-out message into one `\f`-paged call (previously two separate
  `Strings()` calls joined with `.. "\f" ..`).
- `_TrainerSentOutText`/`_AIBattleWithdrawText` (4 call sites in
  `BattleState.lua`): trainer send-out/withdraw lines.
- `_ItemUseBallText06`/`_ItemUseBallText07`/`_ItemUseBallText08`
  (`BattleState:storeCaughtMon`): the PokéDex-added message, and the
  box-transfer message (previously one `Strings()` source manually
  switched between "BILL's PC"/"someone's PC", now two real labels picked
  on `EVENT_MET_BILL`); retires the `%s was\ntransferred to\n%s!` row.
- `_ItemUseBallText00` (`BattleState:throwBall`): retires the
  `This POKéMON\ncan't be caught!` row. Resolves the dodge +
  can't-be-caught two-liner as one `\f`-paged `romText()` call, then
  splits the result into two `sayNext()` pages itself -- confirmed live
  that the battle queue's own `startMessage()` (unlike `TextBox.lua`)
  does not page on `\f`, so a single `sayNext()` call with the raw
  `\f` still inside it overflowed the second sentence off the box.
- `_PlayerMonFaintedText`/`_EnemyMonFaintedText` (`BattleState:onFaint`) and
  `_PokemonFaintedText` (`OverworldController:applyFieldPoison`): retires
  the `%s\nfainted!` row's three collapsed contexts -- `_EnemyMonFaintedText`
  already carries its own "Enemy " wording, so this passes the raw name
  instead of `displayName`'s separate `Strings("Enemy %s", ...)`.
- `_ItemUseNoEffectText`/`_PotionText`
  (`OverworldController:useSoftboiledFieldMove`): retires this call site's
  share of the `It won't have\nany effect.` row (still shared with
  `ItemEffects.lua`/`PartyMenu.lua`'s own call sites, untouched here); the
  healing message now also passes the real recovered-HP amount
  `_PotionText` expects, which the `Strings()` fallback never showed.
- `_FoundItemText`/`_FoundHiddenItemText` (4 call sites in
  `OverworldController.lua`): retires the `%s found\n%s!` row's two
  collapsed contexts.
- `_OnceReleasedText` (`BoxMenu.lua`'s `release()`): retires the
  `Once released,\n%s is\ngone forever. OK?` row. `_MonWasReleasedText`,
  the "X was released outside. Bye X!" follow-up shown right after
  confirming, was missed in an earlier pass and only caught testing the
  flow live -- same `t._X or Strings(...)` pattern, fixed alongside it.
- `_LinedUpText` (`SlotMachine:resolveWin`): retires the
  `%s lined up!\nScored %d coins!` row.
- `_PokemartTellBuyPriceText`/`_PokemartTellSellPriceText`
  (`ShopMenu.lua`'s `buy()`/`sell()`): buy/sell price confirmations,
  previously untracked in the compromise table.
- `_TrainerWantsToFightText` (`LinkBattle.new`): link-battle opening line,
  previously untracked in the compromise table.

Two things this same sweep confirmed should **not** change:

- **`_TrainerAboutToUseText`** (the SHIFT-switch prompt,
  `BattleState:enemyMonFainted`): tried merging its `say()` + `sayChoice()`
  pair into one `\f`-paged `romText()` + `sayChoice()` call, the same way
  as `_ItemUseBallText00` above. `tests/engine/trainer_shift_prompt_bug565.lua`
  caught it immediately (wrong line count, no `\f` paging) -- the battle
  queue's own text renderer behind `sayChoice()` doesn't page `\f` the way
  `TextBox.lua` does for `sayNext()`/`say()`. Left as the original two
  separate `Strings()` calls, with a code comment recording why. Not a
  translation gap either way: both fragments already render correctly
  today via the compromise mechanism, confirmed in a real fr build
  (`"%s is\nabout to use\n%s!"` -> `"%s\nva appeler...\n%s!"`,
  `"Will %s\nchange POKéMON?"` -> `"%s va-t-il\nchanger de POKéMON?"`) --
  this is purely about which mechanism serves it, not whether it's
  translated.
- **`MoveEffects.lua`'s stat-rise/fall messages** (`changeStage`'s four
  rose/greatly-rose/fell/greatly-fell variants): already covered by the
  reordered-arguments compromise table below (`%s's %s\nrose!` row) -- not
  a new gap, just confirmed the existing entry already accounts for it.
  Confirmed there is no upgrade available here even in principle: the
  real ROM labels (`_MonsStatsRoseText`/`_MonsStatsFellText`) extract as
  `"{USER}'s\n{RAM:wStringBuffer}"`/`"{TARGET}'s\n{RAM:wStringBuffer}"` --
  the second line is just a pointer to a RAM buffer pokered fills at
  runtime with the stat name and verb ("ATTACK rose!", "SPCL.DEF greatly
  fell!", ...) via ASM logic the static text extractor never captures.
  Routing through `romText()` here would show the exact same generic
  template the compromise already shows, so there is nothing to retire.
- **Argument-reordering/fragmentary-source compromise rows** (`%sBOX %2d`,
  `PLAYER %s\nBADGES %d\nPOKéDEX %3d\nTIME %6d:%02d`, `HT`/`WT`/`BADGES`,
  and the stat-rise row above): explicitly out of scope for this sweep --
  these need the engine's callsite itself to change its `printf` argument
  order or stop fragmenting the sentence, not just a `romText()` label
  swap, so they stay as compromise entries until a template-level upstream
  fix is worth doing.
- **Swept for the same reversed-argument bug class found in GSC's
  `overrides/<language>/gsc/engine.json`** (see "Stat-change and item/
  move status messages" below): every `Strings()`/`S()` call outside
  `gen2`/`link` with two or more `printf` directives was checked against
  its real callsite argument order and poke-corpus RedBlue/Yellow text
  in fr/de/es/it/ja-Hrkt (real build output,
  `.cache/interactive/<language>/mod/lang/strings.lua`, not just this
  file's ~1 explicit override -- most of RBY's translated content
  resolves automatically through the semantic-anchor/corpus-match
  mechanism rather than a manually-curated override, unlike GSC's
  hand-curated compromise entries). Found clean: `"%s learned\n%s!"`,
  `"%s is\nabout to use\v%s!"`, and the stat-rise/fall family above are
  all already POKéMON/TRAINER-first in every language, matching their
  callsite argument order. `"%s\nwas afflicted\nby %s!"` and the two
  `"%s received..."` messages resolve to nothing in every language
  checked (an untranslated coverage gap, not a wrong-order bug) --
  out of scope for this sweep.

### Fixed upstream: pokered dialogue labels were missing from data/generated/text.lua

gen1recomp `fix/text-extractor-underscore-requirement` (merged upstream as PR #1598, included in gen1recomp release v0.2.12; this project's pin now includes it as of v0.2.19 -- see the "Required upstream capabilities" bullet below for what still isn't covered by this fix alone). Started from the same "extractor requires a leading underscore" theory as a prior version of this doc, but tracing it against a real `pret/pokered` checkout turned up a more precise picture -- there are two independent, differently-behaved label scanners in gen1recomp:

- `tools/extract/text.py`'s `parse_text_file()` does require `_`, and that's a real bug in isolation -- but nothing in the codebase calls this function (no importer, no `__main__` entry point). It looks like dead code from an earlier version of the pipeline.
- The function that actually produces the shipped label list is `text_metadata()` in `tools/make_rom_manifest.py`, feeding `manifest["text"]["labels"]`, which `build_rom_data.py`'s `extract_text()` decodes straight from a ROM. `text_metadata()` already uses the permissive regex (no `_` requirement) since gen1recomp commit `0f581e2f`.

So the real blocker is that the *committed* `tools/rom_manifest.json` is stale relative to `text_metadata()`'s current code, not a source bug. Verified live: running `text_metadata()` today against a real pokered checkout returns 2595 labels including everything below; the committed manifest only has 2585. Cross-checked against a real built French `dialogue.lua`/`dialogue_yellow.lua` to see exactly what's actually missing from a shipped build today:

- **Confirmed missing at the time** (10 labels): both of Viridian City's second Youngster's lines, `TMNotebookText`, the SS Anne kitchen cook's three dish lines, the Viridian fisher's pre-gift line, and three never-previously-documented lines at Silph Co. 9F's nurse (`SilphCo9FNurseDontGiveUpText`/`ThankYouText`/`YouLookTiredText`). **Since resolved for 7 of the 10**, re-verified against the current v0.2.51 pin's own committed manifest (now 2595 labels, matching `text_metadata()`'s live output) and a real built French `dialogue.lua`: the Youngster's two lines, `TMNotebookText`, the three SS Anne dish lines and the Viridian fisher's line all carry real French text today. Only Silph Co. 9F's nurse (3 lines) is still genuinely blocked -- see "Required upstream capabilities" below for why the manifest regeneration alone doesn't reach it.
- **Confirmed already fine** (9 labels): `SilphCo2FSilphWorkerFPleaseTakeThisText` (likely hand-fixed for issue #393 without a full manifest regeneration) and all eight of Yellow's Melanie's House labels (see "Verified working, not a gap" above -- `YELLOW_EXTRA_TEXT_LABELS` already covers that one, it was never actually broken).

`tools/extract/text.py`'s regex was relaxed anyway, for consistency with `text_metadata()` -- harmless since nothing calls it, but no reason to leave a dead copy of the same scanner out of sync. Four of gen1recomp's own hand-ported scripts were carrying the confirmed-missing labels' English text as inline literals (no `game.data.text` lookup at all) and got fixed to read the real label first, same `t[label] or fallback` pattern used everywhere else -- ready to pick up the real text as soon as someone with ROM access regenerates the manifest, which this contribution can't do itself:

- `data/scripts/celadon_eevee.lua` (`TMNotebookText`, the TM pamphlet).
- `data/scripts/flavor/ss_anne_kitchen.lua` (the cook's three dish lines).
- `data/scripts/flavor/viridian_city.lua` (both of the second Youngster's caterpillar-description lines).
- `data/scripts/story5.lua` (the SilphCo2F worker's and Viridian fisher's pre-gift lines -- these already read `t[label]` via the generic `gift()` helper, so only their stale comments needed correcting, plus a real English fallback added where the worker's was missing).

Verified end-to-end ahead of the merge: built the branch's manifest for real against a ROM (see the branch's own commit message for the full byte-for-byte verification), then built this project's mod against that branch (bypassing the `config/pipeline.toml`/`engine_scope.py` pins programmatically, no committed config touched for that check) and confirmed a real French Windows build reads `ViridianCityYoungster2OkThenText`/`CaterpieAndWeedleDescriptionText` from `lang/dialogue.lua` instead of the `literal_handlers.json` override -- side by side against the still-pinned v0.1.91 build, only the fixed branch showed French, the pinned build still showed the hardcoded English literal, exactly as expected. `config/rby/literal_handlers.json`'s `viridian-city-youngster2` handler was removed on that strength, ahead of both the gen1recomp PR being opened and this project's pin catching up -- a deliberate call, not an oversight (see "Verified working, not a gap" above). The PR merged upstream in v0.2.12, and this project's pin was bumped to v0.2.19 (which contains it): a normal pinned build now shows this Youngster's real French text too, with no regression window left open. Silph Co. 9F's nurse needs more than the manifest regeneration alone -- see "Required upstream capabilities" below.

### Translated via a compromise, not blocked (`engine-contract-gap`)

Everything in "Required upstream capabilities" below renders in **English**
with no override reaching it at all. This section is different: every entry
here already shows **translated** text in-game today, through
`overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json`. They are tracked here anyway because
the override is a compromise, not the real localized phrasing -- the
pipeline tags each one `"reason": "engine-contract-gap"` and records why in
its `provenance` field. The goal is to retire this whole section over time:
each row names the concrete engine change that would let the corpus's real,
official localized text replace the compromise. Until then the compromise
stays live and correct-enough, not broken.

Two distinct shapes of compromise, both summarized below (fr shown; every
shipped language carries its own compromise the same way, see each
`overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json`):

**Engine-authored settings/launcher labels** (31 entries,
`config/shared/engine_manifest.json`'s `engine_dynamic_values`, each with a
real callsite, `eligibility: "ineligible"`): these are modern
launcher/options UI, not ROM text, so there is no PokeCorpus qid to match
against at all -- the override is either an AI-generated translation
(flagged `requires in-game visual validation` in its provenance) or the
acronym/label kept as-is where translating it would lose meaning (`SGB`,
`GBC`, `SGB INV`).

| Source | fr override | Callsite |
|---|---|---|
| `OG RED` | `OG ROUGE` | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:276`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:118` (`PaletteFX.modeLabel`) |
| `OG BLUE` | `OG BLEU` | same as above |
| `OG YELLOW` | `OG JAUNE` | same as above |
| `SGB` | `SGB` (kept) | same as above |
| `ADVANCED` | `AVANCE` | same as above |
| `OG INV` | `ORIG. INV` | same as above |
| `SGB INV` | `SGB INV` (kept) | same as above |
| `CLASSIC` | `CLASSIQUE` | same as above |
| `GBC` | `GBC` (kept) | same as above |
| `WINDOWED` | `FENETRE` | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:346`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:169` (`VideoMode.modeLabel`) |
| `BORDERLESS` | `SANS BORD` | same as above |
| `TREES` | `ARBRES` | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:330`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:154` (`TileRenderer.voidFillLabel`) |
| `WATER` | `EAU` | same as above |
| `OFF` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:251`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:99` (`FILTERS`/`FaithfulRes`) |
| `1X` / `2X` / `3X` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:251`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:60` (`FILTERS`/`FaithfulRes`) |
| `NORMAL` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:398`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:218` (`GameSpeed.levelLabel`) |
| `AUTO` / `LANDSCAPE` / `PORTRAIT` / `REVERSE LANDSCAPE` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:357` (`Orientation.modeLabel`) |
| `FAST` / `MEDIUM` / `SLOW` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:126` (`SPEEDS` table) |
| `HEAVY` / `LIGHT` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:447`, `import/LauncherSettings.lua:250` (`TouchControls.hapticLabel`) |
| `auto` / `balanced` / `high` / `low` | (per-context) | `ui/OptionsMenu.lua:264` (`Performance.label`) |

**Corpus translations adapted to the engine's argument order or a
fragmentary source** (6 entries): the real localized ROM phrasing exists in
the corpus, but the engine's `Strings()` callsite either reorders the
`printf` arguments differently than the ROM script did, or only passes a
fragment of the original sentence (a technical field like `HT`/`WT`, a
standalone label like `BADGES`), so a literal per-fragment translation
loses grammatical context a single upstream template change could restore.

| Source | fr override | What's missing |
|---|---|---|
| `%s's %s\nrose!` | `%s voit son %s\naugmenter !` | Reordered stat arguments at shared callsites |
| `%sBOX %2d` | `%sBOITE %2d` | Reordered box-name and numeric arguments |
| `BADGES` | `BADGES` (kept) | Fragmentary standalone source |
| `HT %d′%02d″` | `HT %d′%02d″` (kept) | Missing unit context around numeric arguments |
| `WT %.1flb` | `WT %.1flb` (kept) | Missing unit-context argument |
| `Once released,\n%s is\ngone forever. OK?` | `Une fois libéré,\n%s sera\nperdu à jamais. OK ?` | Reordered release-confirmation context around one argument |

**Corpus translations shared across multiple, incompatible original
contexts** (2 entries): the engine collapses several different ROM strings
into one `Strings()` source key, so one override has to serve every context
even though the original ROM script used different phrasing for each --
only a callsite split upstream (one key per context) would let each one
carry its real, distinct localized text.

| Source | fr override | Original contexts collapsed together |
|---|---|---|
| `%s\nfainted!` | `%s\nest K.O. !` | `rb.text_2.EnemyMonFaintedText`, `rb.text_2.PlayerMonFaintedText`, `rb.text_4.PokemonFaintedText` |
| `POKéDEX` | `POKéDEX` (kept) | `StartMenu.lua`, `PokedexMenu.lua`, `TitleState.lua`, `HallOfFame.lua` labels, no single upstream qid |

**Retired by the v0.2.19 pin bump** (8 entries removed from every language's
`overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json`): `%s lined up!\nScored %d coins!`,
`%s was\ntransferred to\n%s!`, `This POKéMON\ncan't be caught!`,
`PLAYER %s\nBADGES %d\nPOKéDEX %3d\nTIME %6d:%02d`, `evolving!`,
`%s found\n%s!`, `%s's HP\nwas restored!`, and `It won't have\nany effect.`.
The first five are named explicitly in "Fixed upstream" above
(`fix/route-more-messages-through-romtext`, PR #1559); the last three are
not -- discovered instead by running
`pipeline.engine_scope.complete_engine_keys` (the same check
`pipeline/mod.py`'s real build uses to reject a stale override key) against
a real v0.2.19 checkout and diffing it against every override file's key
set. All eight came back with zero matching callsites anywhere in the
engine, meaning they would have made the next real build fail outright
with `engine overrides contain N unknown key(s)` had they been left in
place. That check is only about whether the exact source string still
exists as *some* callsite anywhere in the whole engine -- RBY or not,
`romText()`-routed or not -- which is also why `%s\nfainted!` and
`Once released,...` survive above despite RBY no longer needing either
override: the former still has a genuine `Strings()` call in Gen2's own
`world/gen2/World.lua` (unrelated to this project's RBY mod, but enough
to keep the key valid), and the latter is still a live `Strings()` call
inside `ui/BoxMenu.lua`'s `t._OnceReleasedText or Strings(...)` fallback
idiom -- written by hand rather than through the `romText()` helper, so
the scanner still counts it as a translatable `Strings()` source even
though `t._OnceReleasedText` already wins whenever it resolves. Whichever exact commit
fixed the last three wasn't tracked down -- v0.1.91..v0.2.19 spans close to
200 merged upstream PRs and this project's local checkout of gen1recomp is
shallow, so bisecting each one individually wasn't attempted.

**Retired or renamed by the v0.2.24 pin bump**, discovered by CI rejecting
a real build with `engine overrides contain N unknown key(s)` after that
bump (v0.2.19..v0.2.24 was never audited commit-by-commit the way v0.2.19
itself was):

- **`GBC FX` renamed to `SHADER FX`** on `src/ui/OptionsMenu.lua`'s Options
  menu row -- `src/core/Game2.lua`'s own comments confirm the rename
  (`"...back when it was GBC FX"`). `src/import/LauncherSettings.lua`
  didn't rename its own "GBC FX" row the same way: it dropped the row
  entirely (both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 settings blocks), so it no longer
  emits either literal and needs no override either way. Every language's
  `overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json` entry was renamed to match, with
  the translated value adapted from the prior user-validated `GBC FX`
  wording by swapping the qualifier (not itself re-validated in-game yet).
- **`Use on which one?` retired, not replaced by an override.**
  `src/ui/PartyMenu.lua`'s single generic TM/item target-selection prompt
  was split into two real cart-matching messages,
  `Strings("Use TM on which\nPOKéMON?")` and `Strings("Use item on
  which\nPOKéMON?")`. Unlike the old generic wording (an
  `engine-contract-gap` AI-generated compromise, no compatible qid), both
  new literals match real corpus rows in `corpus/RedBlue/en_msg.txt`
  byte-for-byte and auto-translate via the normal exact-match path with no
  override needed, in every one of fr/de/es/it/ja-Hrkt -- confirmed
  directly against real corpus data before removing the old override entry.
- **`It contained\n%s!` (`ui/BagMenu.lua`'s TM/HM "teach the move?" prompt)
  moved off `Strings()` entirely**, folded into one `romText()` call
  together with the confirmation prompt that used to be a separate
  message: `romText(game.data, "_TeachMachineMoveText", "It
  contained\n%s!\fTeach %s\nto a POKéMON?", moveName, moveName)`.
  `_TeachMachineMoveText` is a real `pokered` ROM label already present in
  `rom_manifest.json`, so `romText()` reads the actual imported ROM's own
  text for it -- the same mechanism, and the same `data.text` table, as
  every other RBY dialogue line, needing no `Strings()` catalog entry or
  semantic anchor at all. `config/rby/semantic_anchor_decisions.json`'s
  `It contained\n%s!` entry (qid `rb.text_6.TeachMachineMoveText`) is
  retired: it can never match the real engine catalog again (that string
  is no longer scanned as a `Strings()` callsite, and the new composite
  fallback isn't in `iter_romtext_fallback_callsites`'s
  `RENDERED_ROMTEXT_FALLBACKS` allowlist -- correctly so, since the
  fallback never actually renders once the real ROM label resolves).

**Retired or renamed by the v0.2.25 pin bump** (`gen1recomp_revision` in
`config/pipeline.toml`/`config/shared/engine_manifest.json`, 24 commits
ahead of v0.2.24, 101 files changed), found the same way: a real build
against the bumped pin, not a source-diff guess.

- **`%s got %s%d for winning! Sent some to MOM!`** (the Gold/Silver
  "sent some money home" battle-prize message) had its `Strings.source()`
  literal rewritten in `src/battle/gen2/Prize.lua` to bake in the same
  `<LINE>`/`<CONT>` structure the real cart's own
  `gs.battle.SentSomeToMomText` corpus row already carries (`%s got
  %s%d\nfor winning!\x0bSent some to MOM!` instead of one flat sentence).
  A real Gold/Silver/Crystal build against the bumped pin failed with
  `Gold engine overrides contain 1 unknown key(s):
  ['%s got %s%d for winning! Sent some to MOM!']`
  (`pipeline/gs_engine.py`'s `match_gs_engine_strings()`, the Gold/Silver
  analogue of the RBY check above). Every one of the six languages'
  `overrides/<language>/gsc/engine.json` had its entry renamed to the new
  key and its own translation reformatted onto the new two-break structure
  -- the original wording was kept verbatim in each language, only the
  `\n`/`\x0b` positions moved, so no re-translation was needed, just
  re-punctuation.
- No other engine-string key broke: real builds for all six GoldSilver-
  Crystal languages and a real universal RBY build (fr, Red + Yellow) all
  reached their usual 100% Gold/Silver-related and RBY-related
  engine-string coverage, plus 100% ROM-aggregate coverage on both sides,
  after this one fix. `config/shared/engine_manifest.json`'s
  `forced_dynamic_keys`/`engine_dynamic_values` free-text `callsite`
  fields (documentation only, never read by the matching logic itself)
  went stale for the entries pointing at `src/ui/OptionsMenu.lua` and
  `src/import/LauncherSettings.lua` line numbers -- both files shifted in
  this bump -- but weren't re-audited line-by-line, the same practical
  call already made for the v0.1.91..v0.2.19 range above.

**Retired by the v0.2.26 pin bump** (`gen1recomp_revision` in
`config/pipeline.toml`/`config/shared/engine_manifest.json`, 15 commits
ahead of v0.2.25, 63 files changed -- mostly mobile/Android/iOS bridge work,
a battle-rule-hooks RFC and Yellow-specific fixes unrelated to translation),
found the same way: a real build against the bumped pin, not a source-diff
guess.

- **`%s's\nhits will never\nmiss!` (X Accuracy's battle message) retired,
  not replaced.** `src/inventory/ItemEffects.lua`'s item-use rewrite
  (adding a shared `itemUseLine()` helper and an item-use jingle, #1635)
  dropped the `Strings("%s's\nhits will never\nmiss!", b.name)` call
  entirely: X Accuracy now prints only the generic "X ACCURACY used!" line,
  matching Dire Hit and Guard Spec (whose own `Strings()`/`romText()` calls
  for "getting pumped"/"protected against stat changes" were removed the
  same way, but neither needed a fix: Dire Hit's was already a `romText()`
  fallback with no engine.json entry, and Guard Spec's identical literal
  has a second, untouched `Strings()` call site in
  `src/battle/TrainerAI.lua` -- a coincidental duplicate kept alive by the
  AI's own use of the same message, not an allowlist exclusion). A real
  RBY build against the bumped pin failed with `engine overrides contain 1
  unknown key(s):
  ["%s's\nhits will never\nmiss!"]` (`pipeline/mod.py`'s
  `generate_mod()`). The entry was removed outright (not renamed) from all
  five languages' `overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json` -- fr, de, es, it,
  ja-Hrkt all had it; ko has no `rby/engine.json`.
- **`%s used\n%s!` moved off `Strings()` without breaking anything, but
  needed a fix of its own.** The same `itemUseLine()` refactor replaced
  `ItemEffects.lua`'s other direct `Strings("%s used\n%s!", ...)` call
  (Repel/X-item usage) with `romText(data, "_ItemUseText001", "%s
  used\n%s!", ...)` -- the same ROM label and *rendered* fallback text
  `BattleState.lua`'s held-item-use line already used, just reached from a
  second call site. No override referenced this literal, so no build
  broke, but `pipeline/engine_backlog.py`'s `iter_romtext_fallback_callsites()`
  only counts a romText fallback as a real (translatable) engine callsite
  when its literal is in the hand-maintained `RENDERED_ROMTEXT_FALLBACKS`
  allowlist -- and only the *other* `_ItemUseText001` fallback phrasing
  (`%s\nused %s!`, `BattleState.lua`'s held-item-in-battle line) was listed.
  Once `ItemEffects.lua` stopped calling `Strings()` on this exact literal
  directly, it silently dropped out of the RBY-related engine-string scan
  (242 -> 240 keys scanned, not just the 1 legitimately retired one) --
  confirmed with a standalone before/after scan of both pinned revisions
  via `pipeline.engine_backlog`/`pipeline.engine_scope`, not just the
  build's pass/fail. Fixed by adding `"%s used\n%s!"` to
  `RENDERED_ROMTEXT_FALLBACKS` alongside its sibling phrasing.
- No other engine-string key broke or silently dropped out of scope: a
  standalone `Strings()`/`romText()` callsite scan diffed against the
  pinned v0.2.25 source found exactly these two keys affected (one
  genuinely gone, one needing the allowlist fix above); real builds for
  all five RBY languages (fr, de, es, it, ja-Hrkt; Red + Yellow) and a real
  Gold/Silver/Crystal build (fr) all reached their usual 100% RBY-related
  (241/241, down from 242/242 -- the one retired key) and Gold/Silver-
  related (302/302, unchanged) engine-string coverage, plus 100%
  ROM-aggregate coverage on every side, after these two fixes.

### Fixed: Surfing Pikachu/Hall of Fame HUD text rewritten upstream

Bumping this project's pin from v0.1.91 to v0.2.19 (`gen1recomp_revision`
in `config/pipeline.toml`/`config/shared/engine_manifest.json`) pulled in
gen1recomp PR #1581 (`feat/pikachu-surf-and-gold-gamecorner`), which
**rewrote** the existing Surfing Pikachu minigame's HUD in
`src/ui/SurfingMinigame.lua` -- not a new file: this project already had
`overrides/<language>/rby/yellow_engine.json` entries for its old HUD text
(`A: done`, `HI    %d`, `New record!`, `SCORE %d`, tagged
`yellow-only-engine-text`, "no PokeCorpus source"). The rewrite replaced
those four with new text -- `Hi-Score!!`, `Pts`, `Radness`, `Total`,
`HP Left` -- and also touched `src/ui/LeaguePC.lua`'s Hall of Fame screen,
adding `HALL OF FAME No`.

**Real build failure caught by this rewrite, now fixed:** a real Yellow mod
build against the bumped pin failed with `Error: Yellow engine override
contains unknown key: 'A: done'` (`pipeline/builder.py`'s Yellow layer
validates `overrides/<language>/rby/yellow_engine.json` against a real
`strings.lua` worksheet dumped from the built game, the same kind of check
`pipeline/mod.py`'s RBY layer does with `complete_engine_keys`). All four
old HUD strings were removed from all five languages' `yellow_engine.json`
files once confirmed dead by the same `complete_engine_keys` check used for
the RBY overrides cleanup above.

**The six new strings, now investigated and covered:** checked each one
against a real Yellow corpus checkout (`poke-corpus/corpus/Yellow`) rather
than assuming AI-generated compromise was the only option:

- `HALL OF FAME No` (`src/ui/LeaguePC.lua`) turned out to be **corpus-backed
  after all** -- `y.league_pc.HallOfFameNoText` is a real ROM string
  (`en_msg.txt:650`), with real official translations in every shipped
  language. The engine draws this label and the team-index number as two
  separate `Font.draw` calls at fixed columns (label at column 1, number at
  column 16), so each language's corpus padding was kept verbatim rather
  than re-measured for gen1recomp's layout -- flagged for in-game visual
  validation like every padded corpus string in this doc, since a per-language
  ROM's own padding was tuned for its own original column position, not
  necessarily gen1recomp's fixed one.
- The other five (`Hi-Score!!`, `Pts`, `Radness`, `Total`, `HP Left`) are
  genuinely engine-authored, confirmed against the real
  `pokeyellow/engine/minigame/surfing_pikachu.asm` disassembly: the
  original ROM's surfing minigame HUD (`wSurfingMinigameRadnessScore` and
  friends are real WRAM variables, so the concept is authentic Yellow, not
  invented by gen1recomp) renders this HUD as fixed graphic tiles, not
  encoded text -- there is no ROM string pointer to align to even in
  principle, the same conclusion the old, now-removed HUD strings had
  independently reached. AI-generated translations were added for all five
  shipped languages, sized to the ~8-tile-wide label column
  `src/ui/SurfingMinigame.lua` actually draws into, and grounded in two real
  sources rather than invented from scratch: this project's own prior
  (now-removed) translation of the very same minigame's old HUD, which
  already established the register for this content per language ("new
  record" phrasing -- `Neuer Rekord!`/`¡Nuevo récord!`/`Nuovo record!`/
  `しんきろく！` -- and `PUNKTE`/`PUNTOS`/`PUNTI` for points); and the real
  RedBlue corpus's `HP UP` item name, which gives the official per-language
  Gen 1 HP abbreviation directly (`KP-PLUS`/`PV PLUS`/`MÁS PS`/`PS-SU`).
  That check also caught German `Radness` drifting into the anglicism
  `Style` where this project's own German conventions elsewhere in this
  same file (`SPIELTEMPO`, `LEISTUNG`, `MUSIK-FILTER`) consistently
  translate rather than borrow -- fixed to `Stil`. All flagged "requires
  in-game visual validation", the same as every other AI-generated entry in
  this project.

**Same audit, applied to semantic anchors too -- now completed.** The same
PR's `_ItemUseBallText00` merge (see "Fixed upstream" above) also orphaned
`config/rby/semantic_anchor_decisions.json`'s `"It dodged the\nthrown BALL!"`
entry, caught by `tests/test_multilingual.py`'s
`test_rby_anchor_callsites_are_unique_and_contextually_eligible` once
`.cache/dependencies/gen1recomp` refreshed to the new pin. Semantic anchors
have no equivalent of `pipeline/mod.py`'s `stale_overrides` build-time
check, so an orphaned one doesn't crash a build -- it just silently stops
matching anything. Running the same "is this key still a real callsite"
audit across the entire anchor/decision config (not just this one test's
narrow probe list) initially found 15 anchor keys in that state; checking
each one against *both* the old (v0.1.91) and new (v0.2.19) checkouts,
rather than the new one alone, separated them into two very different
buckets:

- **12 were already unreachable in v0.1.91 too** -- not a regression from
  this bump at all, and unrelated to it. Investigated individually rather
  than left as a vague "future pass" note, since this project's own
  convention is to verify against real source, not assume:
  - **10 are `romText()` fallback literals**, confirmed one by one against
    the real v0.1.91 source: `_GameCornerCoinCaseText`'s
    `"A COIN CASE is\nrequired!"`, `_MimicLearnedMoveText`'s
    `"%s\nlearned\n%s!"`, `_WokeUpText`'s `"%s\nwoke up!"`,
    `_FluteWokeUpText`'s `"All sleeping\nPOKéMON woke up!"`,
    `_ConfusedNoMoreText`'s `"%s\nsnapped out of\nconfusion!"`,
    `_PPIncreasedText`'s `"%s's PP\nincreased!"`, `_TryingToLearnText`'s
    two span-extracted halves, and two combined composites built from
    *separate* `romText()` calls concatenated at runtime rather than one
    static literal a scanner could ever find: `"1, 2 and... Poof!..."`
    (`_OneTwoAndText`/`_PoofText`/`_ForgotAndText`/`_LearnedMove1Text` in
    `MoveLearnMenu.lua`) and `"What?\n%s is\nevolving!\f..."` (described
    under "genuinely alive" below, alongside the sibling anchor it shares
    its fix with -- it belongs in this bucket by its own history, just
    narrated there for continuity). None of these ten were ever going to
    reach `pipeline.engine_scope.iter_callsites` in the first place:
    `iter_romtext_fallback_callsites` only reports a fixed, audited
    allowlist of 3 fallback strings (see its own docstring), on the theory
    that every other `romText()` fallback resolves its real ROM label and
    is covered by the dialogue catalog instead -- confirmed true for all
    10, so the anchors were genuinely dead weight, safely retired.
  - **1 (`"%s!"`, a `rb.text_2.PlayerMon1Text` "full" extraction) is
    different again: not a `romText()` fallback at all, just never matched
    by any real `Strings()` literal in RBY source, old or new.** The same
    qid/extraction is still live via three unchanged, unrelated composite
    anchors (`"Go! %s!"`, `"Do it! %s!"`, `"Get'm! %s!"`), so removing the
    standalone `"%s!"` anchor doesn't touch anything those three depend
    on -- confirmed with a dedicated test exercising one of them directly,
    since the real-corpus test that used to incidentally cover this same
    extraction shape only ever asserted on the now-removed key.
  - **1 (`"SEEN %d  OWNED %d"`, Pokédex footer) turned out to be dead in a
    third, different way: not superseded by `romText()`, but already
    covered by an entirely separate, pre-existing mechanism.** First pass
    at this treated it like `<Diploma>` -- traced the stale anchor's wrong
    qid (`ui/PokedexMenu.lua`'s real callsite is
    `Strings("SEEN %3d  OWN %3d", seen, owned)`; the anchor pointed at
    `rb.text_2.DexSeenOwnedText`, but pokered actually has two standalone
    corpus strings for this, `rb.pokedex.PokedexSeenText`/`PokedexOwnText`)
    and rebuilt it as a "parts" anchor combining both real labels with the
    engine's own `%3d` printf directives, verified end-to-end against the
    real corpus for all five languages. An independent review then found
    that fix was solving an already-solved problem:
    `pipeline/join.py`'s `pokedex_footer_catalog` -- pre-existing,
    already tested in `tests/test_pipeline.py`, using the exact same two
    qids -- runs unconditionally in `pipeline/mod.py` and overwrites
    `engine_values["SEEN %3d  OWN %3d"]` via a plain `dict.update()` call
    *after* the semantic-anchor matcher runs, regardless of whether the
    anchor resolved, failed, or didn't exist at all. Confirmed directly:
    calling `pokedex_footer_catalog` alone, with no anchor in the picture,
    already produces the identical correct values for all five languages
    (fr `VUS %3d  PRIS %3d`, de `GES %3d  BES %3d`, es `VIST %3d  TIEN
    %3d`, it `VIST %3d  PRES %3d`, ja-Hrkt's longer
    `みつけたかず`/`つかまえたかず` labels). So the original stale
    `"SEEN %d  OWNED %d"` anchor was never actually blocking a real
    translation the way `<Diploma>` was -- it was just dead weight, the
    same as the other 11. The parts-based replacement anchor added real
    verification value (confirming `pokedex_footer_catalog`'s qids are
    correct) but zero runtime effect, so it was removed rather than kept:
    a duplicate, unused code path is its own maintenance liability (a
    future printf-width change on this field would need updating in two
    places instead of one, and only one of them is actually load-bearing).
- **3 were genuinely alive in v0.1.91 and went dead in v0.2.19.** All three
  turned out to be superseded by a real upstream improvement, not broken by
  one -- but one of them was hiding an actual bug:
  - `"It dodged the\nthrown BALL!"` (`rb.text_6.ItemUseBallText00`): merged
    into a combined `romText()` call by PR #1559 (see "Fixed upstream"
    above). The real ROM label now supplies the translation directly, so
    the anchor decision was retired (removed from
    `semantic_anchor_decisions.json`), not repaired.
  - `"Congratulations!\nYour %s\nevolved into\n%s!"` and the related
    `"What?\n%s is\nevolving!\fCongratulations!..."` composite (the latter
    was actually already dead pre-bump, but shares the same fix and was
    retired alongside it): `src/pokemon/Evolution.lua` and
    `src/ui/EvolutionState.lua` now call
    `romText(game.data, "_IsEvolvingText", ...)` and
    `romText(game.data, "_EvolvedText", ...)` directly, so both anchor
    decisions -- and the test exercising their composition logic
    (`test_evolution_messages_compose_original_flow`) -- were retired.
  - `"<Diploma>"` (`rb.diploma.DiplomaText`): **this one was a real,
    user-visible regression, not a beneficial retirement.** The engine
    literal itself changed, unrelated to any `romText()` migration:
    `src/ui/Diploma.lua`'s call went from `Strings("<Diploma>")` (v0.1.91,
    line 32) to `Strings("Diploma")` (v0.2.19, line 113) -- the angle
    brackets were simply dropped from the source string. No other matching
    mechanism (auto-exact, structural, or the corpus's own
    `\x70`-wrapped text) can bridge that gap on its own, so a real build
    against the bumped pin would have silently shown English "Diploma"
    instead of "Diplôme" (confirmed directly: replaying the same corpus
    row through `match_engine_catalog` returns `"Diplôme"`/`semantic` under
    the old key and empty/`unmatched` under the new one). Fixed by
    re-keying the decision from `"<Diploma>"` to `"Diploma"` and correcting
    its stale `Diploma.lua:32` callsite citation to `:113`; the now-redundant
    `source_aliases: ["Diploma"]` (identical to the corrected key) was
    dropped. `test_rby_anchor_callsites_are_unique_and_contextually_eligible`
    now also asserts `"Diploma"` stays a real, eligible RBY callsite.

### Required upstream capabilities

Still genuinely out of reach: no hook, no catalog entry can fix these
from the translation mod without gen1recomp itself changing.

- **Silph Co. 9F's nurse, the one label the manifest regeneration didn't close:**
  was "not fixable from this project without gen1recomp vendoring the real,
  unmodified `pokered` ASM source" -- the actual cause turned out to be a
  stale committed manifest, not a source bug (see "Fixed upstream: pokered
  dialogue labels were missing from data/generated/text.lua" above, now
  resolved for every other site that sweep found). Silph Co. 9F's nurse
  (`SilphCo9FNurseDontGiveUpText`/`ThankYouText`/`YouLookTiredText`,
  found by the same sweep, never previously documented) needs more than
  that regeneration alone: `data/scripts/flavor/silph_co_9f.lua`'s
  `TEXT_SILPHCO9F_NURSE` is a static command table
  (`face_player`/`check_flag`/`heal_party`/`fade`/`wait`/`show_text`
  rows), not a function, with its three lines as bare literals -- no
  `game.data.text` lookup at all, so even a fresh manifest doesn't help
  until that script itself is rewritten. Two ways to close it, neither
  done yet: an upstream gen1recomp rewrite of that script (needs live
  testing this project can't do), or a `config/rby/literal_handlers.json`
  entry the same way as the now-obsolete Youngster2 handler used to (see
  "Verified working, not a gap" above) -- blocked on extending
  `pipeline/literals.py`'s flow DSL with `heal_party`/`fade`/`wait`
  operations, which it doesn't support yet
  (only `say`/`choice`/`if`/`set_flag`/`inventory`/`money`/
  `script_move`/`done`/`engage_trainer`). Those three primitives already
  exist as ordinary script commands in gen1recomp
  (`src/script/Commands.lua`), so the DSL extension would call/mirror
  existing engine behavior rather than invent new mechanics -- but
  `map_scripts:register` is a single-winner override per TEXT constant
  (`src/script/MapScripts.lua:3-8`), so a handler that only translated
  the text and dropped `heal_party`/`fade` would be a real gameplay
  regression (the nurse would stop healing the party), not just an
  incomplete translation.

## Gold and Silver

### Silver: supported by declaration, then by real dual-ROM extraction

The mod's `manifest.json` declares `"games": ["gold", "silver"]` instead of
just `["gold"]` (`pipeline/gs_mod.py`'s `generate_gs_mod()`). The rest of
this section (measurement, aliasing) predates a later change that added a
real dual-ROM extraction path: `pipeline/roms.py`'s `verify_gs_rom()` now
accepts either a real Gold or a real Silver ROM (matching either SHA-1) and
reports which one, `config/pipeline.toml` carries both `[rom.gold]` and
`[rom.silver]`, and `tools/gs_extract.lua` selects the matching import
manifest (`rom_manifest_gold.json`/`rom_manifest_silver.json`) for whichever
edition was detected. There is still no Silver-specific corpus join --
Gold's own extracted text and corpus alignment are reused as-is for a
Silver-sourced build too. The reasoning below for why that's safe (not why
it was originally declared-only) is what's still current:

- Gold and Silver share one `pokegold` source tree. gen1recomp's own
  `tools/make_silver_manifest.py` derives Silver's import manifest from
  Gold's, touching only `romSha1` and `symbols` -- and a scripted diff of
  the two manifests' 2057 named symbols found only 818 actually differ,
  every one of them a sprite (556), a `*PokedexEntry` symbol (241, which
  doesn't even feed the dialogue text table -- resolved separately into
  `pokedex.lua`), or misc graphics (21). **Zero of the 873 `*Text*` symbols
  and zero of the 9 `*Script*` symbols differ.**
- The dialogue text table this mod's `dialogue.lua` overrides
  (`data.text`/`text.lua`, keyed `bank:address` via
  `src/script/gen2/Opcodes.key`) is built the same way for both editions;
  gen1recomp's own importer (`GameVersion.forSha1`) already picks the
  correct manifest per ROM at runtime without any help from this project.
- A mod override is a plain string-key match against whatever `data.text`
  the *current* import produced (`Vm:showText`: `self.text[textKey]`,
  folded on by `src/mods/Registry.lua`'s `override`). If a Gold-authored
  key doesn't exist in a Silver import's own table, the override silently
  never fires and the player sees Silver's own correct English text --
  never garbled or wrong text, just occasionally untranslated.
- `src/mods/ModTargets.lua`'s `specApplies()` already treats `"silver"` as
  a first-class `games` token (same `GameVersion.VERSIONS` lookup as
  `"gold"`), so declaring both is enough for the engine's own mod loader to
  apply this mod to a Silver save with no further engine-side work.
- This project's own automatic dialogue join
  (`pipeline/gs_join.py`'s `join_gs_pointers`) matches primarily by
  normalized English text, not by pointer -- `bank:address` is only used
  to look up the small set of hand-reviewed, Gold-sha1-pinned overrides in
  `config/gsc/pointer_decisions.json`/`placeholder_decisions.json` and as
  the final write-back key. Any of those specific entries that do differ
  between editions degrade the same way: lose the hand-reviewed override,
  fall back to automatic resolution or `UNRESOLVED`, never corrupt.

**Measured, not just argued from the named-symbol proxy, and now closed to
100%:** `tools/spike_gold_silver_text_overlap.lua` (a standalone
measurement script, not wired into the pipeline) extracts the real
`data.text` key set from a real Gold ROM and a real Silver ROM
independently and compares them directly. Result: 3036 of 3044 keys
(99.7%) matched exactly between the two ROMs out of the box. The 8 that
didn't were all field-move prompts in bank `03` (Rock Smash/Strength:
`"A POKéMON may be able to break it."`, `"{STRBUF} used STRENGTH!"`, and
similar) -- paired up by content, every one shifted the same uniform -2
bytes between editions while carrying byte-identical English text.
`config/gsc/silver_pointer_aliases.json` records those 8 `{gold_pointer:
silver_pointer}` pairs, and `gs_text_catalog_from_join()`
(`pipeline/gs_mod.py`) now aliases each Gold pointer's resolved
translation onto its Silver pointer too. **Dialogue-pointer coverage
between Gold and Silver is the full 3044/3044 (100%) when building from a
Gold ROM,** verified by rebuilding a real French mod and confirming all 16
pointers (8 Gold + 8 Silver) carry matching text in the generated
`dialogue.lua`. This confirmed reusing Gold's own extraction and corpus
join for Silver too was safe -- it's why the later dual-ROM extraction
path (`[rom.silver]`, `verify_gs_rom()`, `gs_extract.lua`'s manifest
selection, `.cache/interactive-gs/` as the shared cache dir for either
edition) still doesn't need a separate Silver-specific corpus join: a real
Silver ROM build resolves 3036/3051 pointers on its own (99.5%, one
Silver-native pointer with no Gold-side alias), reusing the exact same
Gold-sourced translation catalog.

Crystal was a different, bigger question -- see the next section for how it
was actually resolved.

### Crystal: mandatory companion ROM, its own corpus join, shared engine strings

Crystal uses a `pokegold`-derived but materially different codebase from
Gold/Silver: of 2011 symbol names shared between Gold and Crystal, 1926
(95.8%) resolve to a different `bank:address` -- essentially no free ride
from Gold/Silver's own resolved dialogue catalog, unlike Silver's near-zero
divergence from Gold. gen1recomp's own engine already has full Crystal
support though: `tools/rom_manifest_crystal.json` is complete, and
`src/import/RomExtractorGen2.lua` already has edition branches for
`"crystal"` throughout (palettes, sprites, title screen, credits, music,
text/opcodes, trade). This project's own `tools/gs_extract.lua` (a headless
LuaJIT wrapper around that extractor, not gen1recomp's) just needed the same
treatment as its existing `"gold"`/`"silver"` branches, accepting
`"crystal"` and selecting `rom_manifest_crystal.json`.

poke-corpus has a separate `Crystal/` collection in the exact same file
format as `GoldSilver/` (`{qid,en,<lang>}_msg.txt`, same `<LINE>`/`<CONT>`/
`<PARA>`/`@`/`[NULL]`/`<PK><MN>` tokens), under a flat `c.text.*` qid
namespace with zero qid overlap with `gs.*` -- but 86% of GoldSilver's own
unique English text reappears somewhere in Crystal's, so a from-scratch join
against Crystal's own corpus (not a cross-collection qid alias) resolves
most of it automatically: `pipeline.gs_join.join_gs_pointers()` already
matches by normalized English text, not by pointer, so despite its "gs_"
name it is edition-agnostic and needed no changes at all --
`pipeline/crystal_mod.py`'s `join_crystal_dialogue()` just calls it against
Crystal's own extracted TSVs and its own corpus collection. A real build
resolved 3864/4010 dialogue pointers (96.4%) automatically with no manual
help at all.

Closing the rest took two further passes, both against real, verifiable
ground truth rather than guesswork. First, Crystal's qid namespace turned
out to mirror Gold/Silver's own per-location taxonomy exactly (same
trailing symbol names, `c.` prefix instead of `gs.`), so Gold's own
already-reviewed `config/gsc/pointer_decisions.json` (164 entries picking
the real, reachable text over an unused duplicate) doubled as a lookup:
whenever a Crystal pointer's ambiguous candidates included exactly one
qid whose `gs.`-prefixed counterpart Gold's reviewers already confirmed
was a real pointer's target, the same pick applied to Crystal -- resolving
22 of 113 ambiguous pointers this way
(`pipeline/crystal_mod.py`'s `load_crystal_pointer_decisions()`). Second,
the [pokecrystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) (the
user's own clone) was built from source with `rgbds`, confirmed to
produce a ROM byte-for-byte identical to the real retail cartridge (both
hash to `f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133`), and its own
linker-generated `.sym` file -- an authoritative `bank:address` -> real
ASM symbol name map for every one of Crystal's 4010 pointers, not just
the 97 gen1recomp's own extractor already names -- resolved all but one
of the remaining 91 ambiguous pointers outright; the one leftover (two
distinct corpus qids sharing an identical trailing symbol name) was
confirmed by grepping the real disassembly source directly. This closed
French's own ambiguous-pointer gap completely (113 entries), but German,
Spanish, Italian and Japanese each had their own, distinct residual
ambiguous pointers (French's disambiguation only fixes a pointer for
every language at once when the *same* pointer was ambiguous for all of
them -- a language whose corpus text for a given English line happens to
match only one candidate never shows up as ambiguous in the first place,
so it needed no decision, while a language matching several still did).
The same symbol-table method was re-run against each of their own
remaining unresolved pointers, extending
`config/gsc/crystal_pointer_decisions.json` to 210 entries in total --
every decision re-verified against the real `.sym` file, not assumed from
French's.

The rest were never ambiguous, they simply had no corpus row at all --
and the same real symbol table confirmed why: every one resolves to a
genuine Mobile Adapter GB / PokeCom Center script (real, scripted content
in pokecrystal's own `maps/PokecomCenterAdminOfficeMobile.asm` and
related files), a peripheral never sold outside Japan. Spanish and
Japanese poke-corpus data turned out to already carry real, official
translations for every one of these lines -- so only French, German and
Italian genuinely lacked corpus coverage here. Those three now carry
hand-written, AI-generated text instead (`overrides/<lang>/gsc/
crystal_dialogue.json`, loaded by `pipeline/crystal_mod.py`'s
`load_crystal_dialogue_overrides()`): 17 pointers for French, 9 for
German (a subset of French's own set -- Spanish/Japanese's corpus already
covered the rest for German too, it turned out), and 16 for Italian
(mostly the same set, plus one pointer -- `62:6532` -- that French's own
corpus resolves but Italian's doesn't). Each entry's line/page-break
structure is checked to match the English source's own `<LINE>`/`<PARA>`/
`<CONT>` positions exactly (same count and order of breaks, not
necessarily the same word-for-word segment boundaries) before being
accepted.

**Crystal dialogue resolution is 3994/4010 (99.60%) for all five
translated languages (fr/de/es/it/ja-Hrkt), i.e. 100% of the 3994
pointers that carry any real, visible text** -- the only 16 left in every
language are markup-only entries with nothing to translate at all, the
same category Gold/Silver's own 100%-covered catalog also carries.
Korean stays at 0/3994 (no Crystal corpus exists for it at all, see
below).

Crystal ships as a mandatory companion ROM merged into the same
`translation-<lang>-gen2` mod as Gold/Silver, the same way Yellow is a
mandatory companion for the universal RBY mod: `pipeline/gs_mod.py`'s
`build_gs()` now always extracts and joins a Crystal ROM too, and
`generate_gs_mod()` writes Crystal's own resolved dialogue to a separate
`lang/dialogue_crystal.lua` layer, applied at runtime only when
`GameVersion.get() == "crystal"` (there is no upstream `isCrystal()` helper
the way there's an `isYellow()`, but `.get() == "crystal"` is exactly what
`isGold()`/`isYellow()`/`isBlue()` do internally for their own edition, so
this mirrors `pipeline/mod.py`'s own `yellow_isyellow_guard_lines()`
pattern for RBY's Yellow layer). The manifest declares `"gold"`, `"silver"`,
and `"crystal"`. Korean has no Crystal corpus in poke-corpus (no
`ko_msg.txt`, unlike GoldSilver's own six languages) -- rather than drop
Korean from the whole generation-2 release, `join_crystal_dialogue()`
detects the missing corpus file and returns an empty catalog instead of
raising, so a Korean build still succeeds and still declares Crystal
compatibility, it just leaves Crystal's own dialogue in English.

Since resolved: Crystal's own named catalogs (species/moves/items/trainer
classes) reuse Gold/Silver's own already-translated values for the shared
roster, verified against real builds, plus a dedicated
`pipeline/crystal_registries.py` for the handful of records genuinely
Crystal-exclusive (item names, trainer class names, a landmarks subset).
Crystal-exclusive content (MoveTutor, GenderSelect, Battle Tower, Buena's
Password -- the 48 keys catalogued as `"crystal-only-feature"` in
`config/gsc/engine_scope_exclusions.json`, excluded from Gold/Silver's own
engine-string metric precisely because they're Crystal's to translate, not
Gold/Silver's) is now translated for fr/de/es/it (48/48) and ja-Hrkt (47/48);
`ko` has no Crystal corpus and stays untranslated. A dedicated release gate
(`tools/gate_gs_dialogue.lua`'s `hasCrystal` path) now verifies Crystal's own
dialogue and registries are selected only under a Crystal save and never
leak onto Gold or Silver, alongside Gold/Silver's existing gates. Crystal's
own engine strings (the Options/Menu `Strings()` catalog) need no separate
work at all: `ui/gen2/OptionsMenu.lua`/`MainMenu.lua` have no edition
branches, so Gold/Silver's own `overrides/<lang>/gsc/engine.json` (937 keys,
the Gold/Silver-related subset of the shared engine catalog) already applies
unchanged on a Crystal save.

### Fixed: rows already reachable through an existing public hook

`PcMenu`'s five storage-menu rows (`Withdraw Pokémon`, `Deposit Pokémon`,
`Change box`, `Move Pokémon w/o mail`, `See ya!`) and the battle party
submenu's `Switch`/`Stats` rows are *not* private-class reads: both already
run through public list hooks (`ui.pc.items`, `ui.party.submenu`) that this
mod already wraps for other rows (`Cancel`, item-PC actions, decoration,
mail box). They were simply missing from `config/gsc/literal_handlers.json`.
Likewise the START menu's two-line highlighted-entry description
(`Pokémon database`, `Party Pokémon status`, `Contains items`, and five
more) runs through `ui.start_menu.items`, whose `item.label` field this mod
already localized -- `item.desc` just wasn't wired up yet. All now fixed;
`Party <PK><MN>\nstatus`'s French translation is slightly longer than the
original two-glyph line and should get an in-game width check.

### Fixed: PcMenu's own CHANGE BOX save flow

`Strings()` already worked fine elsewhere in `src/ui/gen2/PcMenu.lua`
(`self:notice({ Strings(MON_HOLDING_MAIL[1]), Strings(MON_HOLDING_MAIL[2]) })`,
its one existing call site), it just hadn't been wired up for this one flow.
(The five storage-menu row labels just above are already translated too,
but through a different mechanism entirely -- a translation-mods-side hook
into the public `ui.pc.items` list, not an engine-side `Strings()` call; see
"Fixed: rows already reachable..." above. `entry.label` itself still
reaches `Chrome.print` as a raw, unwrapped string,
`Chrome.print(entry.label, 2, ty)`.)

`PcMenu.lua`'s `savePrompt()` (`CHANGE BOX`'s own save confirmation --
switching which box is the active one, not moving Pokémon between boxes;
that's the separate `MOVE POKéMON W/O MAIL` entry) used to stay entirely in
English: not just the overwrite/saving lines it shares with `SaveMenu.lua`
(`OVERWRITE_PROMPT`/`SAVING_PROMPT`, previously plain untranslated tables),
but also its own done messages (`{ name .. " saved", "the game." }`/
`"Could not save."`, built by concatenation rather than `SaveMenu.lua`'s
`"%s saved\nthe game."` format string) and its own `"YES"`/`"NO"` choice,
none of which went through `Strings()` at all.

Fixed on gen1recomp, merged as PR #1774 (`7d5856f9`): `SaveMenu.lua` now
exports `OVERWRITE_PROMPT_SOURCE`/`SAVING_PROMPT_SOURCE` and its
`twoLines()` helper (the plain `OVERWRITE_PROMPT`/`SAVING_PROMPT` tables
they replaced are gone, along with the duplicate literal text that had to
be kept in sync by hand), and `PcMenu:savePrompt()` calls through them the
same way `SaveMenu:prompt()` does, plus wraps its own done/YES-NO messages
in `Strings()` reusing `SaveMenu.lua`'s exact keys (`"%s saved\nthe
game."`, `"Could not save."`, `"YES"`, `"NO"`) -- a translation covering
`SaveMenu.lua`'s screen needs no `PcMenu`-specific fork for any of those.
The confirm prompt itself gets one new key, `"#MON BOX, data\nwill be
saved. OK?"` (see the truncation note below). Live as of gen1recomp
v0.2.24 (`aea38240`), well within the project's current pin:
this project's own `overrides/{fr,de,es,it,ja-Hrkt,ko}/gold/engine.json`
already carry the new confirm-prompt key (merged to `main` as PR #40).

Previously deliberately left out of `fix/translate-gold-title-and-save-menus`:
that branch's own scope was already widened once by a review finding a
`PcMenu.lua` regression (an earlier version broke this exact screen by
changing `OVERWRITE_PROMPT`'s type), so extending translation to a second
screen was left for this follow-up rather than risking a second regression
in the same PR.

**The confirm prompt's own text is a truncation too, same underlying cause
as the SAVE screen's overwrite prompt below.** `PcMenu.lua`'s own English
source for `"#MON BOX, data\nwill be saved. OK?"` is itself a two-line
truncation of the real three-line cart text (`gs.common_2.ChangeBoxSaveText`,
poke-corpus `GoldSilver`): `"When you change a<LINE>#MON BOX,
data<CONT>will be saved. OK?<DONE>"` -- but where the port keeps the
*first* two lines of `AlreadyASaveFileText` for the overwrite prompt, here
it keeps the *last* two of `ChangeBoxSaveText` instead (the same fixed
2-line box, just a different pre-existing truncation choice this project
didn't introduce). Every other shipped language's own cart text for this
line runs one line longer than English's three (`fr`/`de`/`es`/`it` all
have four segments, `ja-Hrkt`/`ko` have three like English), so the same
"keep the cart's own last two lines" rule was applied uniformly rather than
composing anything new -- and unlike the overwrite prompt, it happened to
work out clean: every language's last two lines read as a complete,
non-dangling sentence (`fr` "les données sont / sauvegardées. OK?", `de`
"wird das Spiel / gesichert!", `es` "los datos se / guardarán. ¿Vale?",
`it` "dati vengono / salvati. Va bene?", `ja-Hrkt` "どうじに　レポートが　
かかれます / いいですか？", `ko` "동시에 레포트가 기록되어집니다 /
괜찮습니까?") -- confirmed in-game for fr. Real corpus phrasing ships as-is
here, no compromise needed, but it is still missing real cart content (the
"when you change a POKéMON BOX" framing, and for `fr`/`de`/`es`/`it` also
the literal mention of the box itself) for the same reason as the overwrite
prompt: this port's fixed 2-line box has no pagination.

### Verified working, not a gap

- **`ja-Hrkt`'s garbled `Options_BattleScene.On` corpus text is never
  actually used.** `gs.options_menu.Options_BattleScene.On`'s real Gold ROM
  Japanese text extracts as `"５てへぷダレのじっくり　みる"`, which reads as
  corrupted/mis-decoded (mixed digits and unrelated kana, unlike its clean
  `Off` counterpart `"とばして　みる"`) -- looked like a real translation
  gap worth chasing down. It isn't reachable: `ui/gen2/OptionsMenu.lua`'s
  `BATTLE SCENE` and `MENU ACCOUNT` rows both draw their value through the
  exact same shared literal, `Strings("ON ")`/`Strings("OFF")` (lines 65 and
  95), rather than through separate per-row keys. The real cart shows two
  different, context-specific phrases for these two screens in Japanese
  (`Options_MenuAccount.On` cleanly extracts as `"ひょうじ　する"`,
  "display"), but this port's shared key can only carry one value, so it
  already had to use a generic word instead of either row's own real phrase
  -- matching fr/de/es/it's own choice of a generic "yes"-style word here
  rather than either row's real cart phrasing. `ON `/`OFF` ship `"オン"`/
  `"オフ"` (ja-Hrkt) and `"온"`/`"오프"` (ko, AI-generated -- ko has no RBY
  release to copy from), reusing the same generic word already established
  for the *other*, unpadded `"ON"`/`"OFF"` key (RBY's own launcher/options
  toggle, `ui/OptionsMenu.lua`, `ui/ShaderFXScreen.lua`,
  `import/LauncherSettings.lua`, `import/LauncherView.lua` -- seven call
  sites in total). ja-Hrkt and ko's `OFF` previously carried
  `Options_BattleScene.Off`'s own context-specific phrase by mistake (a
  plausible-looking but wrong match, since `OFF` is the one key shared by
  every one of those seven other call sites too); ko's `ON ` had the same
  mismatch for `Options_BattleScene.On`. Both fixed to the generic word.

### Fixed upstream (engine changes, not just this project's config)

- **Clock UI (weekdays, `o'clock`, `MORN`/`DAY`/`NITE`):** `DAYS`
  (SUNDAY..SATURDAY), the `PrintHour` daytime word, and the `"%s
  o'clock"`/`"%d min."` suffixes on InitClock's screens, the main menu
  clock box and the Pokegear's own clock card were plain Lua literals with
  no `Strings()` lookup at all -- reported from a real Spanish Gold build.
  Fixed on gen1recomp `fix/translate-clock-and-day-of-week` (merged,
  PR #1450): both now live in `Strings`-backed lookups in
  `src/core/gen2/Clock.lua`. `SUNDAY`..`SATURDAY` and `MORN`/`DAY`/`NITE`
  translate for free -- `pipeline/engine.py`'s corpus alignment matches
  them byte-for-byte against poke-corpus's own literal ROM text rows.
  `"%s o'clock"`/`"%d min."` don't align automatically the same way (see
  the compromise table below), but the real corpus text is still directly
  available at `corpus/GoldSilver/{lang}_msg.txt` lines 904-905 (parallel
  to `qid_msg.txt`'s `gs.timeset.String_oclock`/`String_min`) -- no longer
  a `Strings()` gap either way. This PR didn't touch the separate `"AM"`/
  `"PM"` marker each of these three screens also draws, but a later one
  did -- see the next bullet.
- **Clock "AM"/"PM" marker:** `src/ui/gen2/MainMenu.lua:174`,
  `src/ui/gen2/Pokegear.lua:1963`, and `src/ui/gen2/Pokegear.lua:2377` now
  all read `Strings(hour < 12 and "AM" or "PM")` -- fixed on gen1recomp as
  part of `fix/translate-gold-title-and-save-menus` (`fad7443f`/
  `654650e3`, merged as PR #1759, in v0.2.21). Verified against real
  corpus text (`gs.print_hours_mins.String_AM`/`String_PM`, poke-corpus
  `GoldSilver`): `fr`/`de`/`es`/`it`/`ko` all show plain `"AM@"`/`"PM@"`,
  identical to the English source, so no override is needed -- matches
  `overrides/{fr,de,es,it,ko}/gold/engine.json`'s current state, which
  correctly carries none. `ja-Hrkt`'s corpus row for this exact string is
  `[NULL]` (absent), consistent with Japanese Gold's clock not using this
  marker on the cart at all; left as English-identical no-op there too,
  same as every other shipped language.

### Translated via a compromise, not blocked (`engine-contract-gap`)

Same pattern as RBY above -- these 22 entries (`overrides/<language>/gold/engine.json`,
common across fr/de/es/it/ja-Hrkt/ko) already show translated text in-game,
adapted to the engine's split or reordered contract rather than the exact
official phrasing:

| Source | fr override | What's missing |
|---|---|---|
| `%d #MON seen\n%d #MON owned\n\nPROF.OAK's\nRating:` | `%d POKéMON vus\n%d POKéMON pris\fÉvaluation du\nPROF. CHEN :` | Adapted to the engine's two-`printf` contract |
| `%s got %s%d for winning!` | `%s remporte %s%d !` | Currency/printf order follows the engine contract |
| `%s got %s%d for winning! Sent some to MOM!` | `%s remporte %s%d ! Une partie est\nenvoyée à MAMAN !` | Currency/printf order follows the engine contract |
| `%s o'clock` | `%sh` | Bare-suffix corpus source (`gs.timeset.String_oclock`), no placeholder to align against the engine's `%s` template; French drops the space to match `"20h"` |
| `%d min.` | `%d min.` (identical to source) | Bare-suffix corpus source (`gs.timeset.String_min`); coincidentally the same word in English and French |
| `A▶PRINT` / `B▶CANCEL` / `L▶BEFORE` / `R▶NEXT` | `A▶IMPRIMER` / `B▶ANNULER` / `L▶RETOUR` / `R▶SUITE` | Physical button glyph retained |
| `Fly to %s?` | `Voler vers %s ?` | Adapted to the engine's printf contract |
| `LEFT SIDE` / `RIGHT SIDE` | `À GAUCHE` / `À DROITE` | Decoration-menu labels, engine contract |
| `START>CANCEL` | `START>ANNULER` | Physical button retained |
| `Registered the` + `that item.` | `Objet enregistré :` + `d'enregistrer.` | One ROM sentence (`CantRegisterItemText`/`RegisteredItemText`) split across two engine fragments |
| `You can't register` | `Impossible` | Split-contract half of `CantRegisterItemText` |
| `You have no more\nPOKéMON that can\x0bfight!` | `Plus de POKéMON\napte au combat !` | Adapted from `gs.common_2.NoUsableMonText` |
| `{PLAYER} used the` | `{PLAYER} utilise :` | Item-on-next-fragment order |
| `OT/` | `DO/` | Compact engine label, slash retained |
| `HP` | `PV` | `ui/gen2/PhotoStudio.lua:164`, fragmentary standalone source |
| `№.` | `N°` | `ui/gen2/PhotoStudio.lua:157`, fragmentary standalone source (`HallOfFame.lua`/`SummaryMenu.lua` print the same glyph directly, outside `Strings()`) |
| `{STRBUF}.` | `{STRBUF}.` (kept) | `ui/gen2/TradeAnim.lua:187`, runtime name fragment, punctuation-only and language-invariant |
| `There is already a\nsave file. Is it` | `Il y a déjà une\nsauvegarde. La` | Missing the real ROM's third `<CONT>` page -- see below |

Two more are per-language only, each documented individually in the relevant
`overrides/<language>/gold/engine.json`: German and Korean also override
`"%s\nis about to use...\nWill %s\nchange POKéMON?"` (the German ROM omits
the player-name printf the engine expects), and Japanese and Korean also
override `"Congratulations!"` (the Japanese diploma folds that idea into the
preceding line instead of a standalone sentence).

**SAVE overwrite prompt (`AlreadyASaveFileText`), missing its third `<CONT>`
page -- a uniform gap, not a per-language one:** `src/ui/gen2/SaveMenu.lua`'s
own English source for this prompt (`OVERWRITE_PROMPT`/
`OVERWRITE_PROMPT_SOURCE`) is itself a two-line truncation of the real
three-line cart text (`gs.common_2.AlreadyASaveFileText`, poke-corpus
`GoldSilver`): `"There is already a<LINE>save file. Is it<CONT>OK to
overwrite?<DONE>"`. On the real cart, `<CONT>` advances to a second textbox
page (a button press) before the YES/NO choice appears; this port's
`SpeechTextbox` (18x4, `Chrome.textbox(0, 12, 18, 4)`) has no paging at all
-- `drawPanel()` prints exactly two fixed lines and shows the YES/NO box
alongside them immediately, so there is no way to display a third page even
in principle. This is not a translation gap in the usual sense: **English
itself is missing the same "OK to overwrite?" clause**, ending on the same
kind of dangling "Is it" its own truncation leaves. Every shipped
language's override here is the same mechanical quote of its own cart's
first two lines, sharing that flaw to varying degrees depending on where
each language's own sentence happens to break -- German's and Spanish's
first two lines happen to already read as a complete standalone sentence
(`"Es gibt bereits<LINE>einen Spielstand."`, `"Ya existe un<LINE>archivo
guardado."`), while French's and Italian's don't (`"Il y a déjà
une<LINE>sauvegarde. La"` dangles on a bare object pronoun with its verb
"remplacer" stranded on the dropped third page; `"C'è già un
gioco<LINE>salvato in"` cuts mid-preposition) -- confirmed against a real
fr/it build screenshot. A composed, non-corpus paraphrase for French/
Italian was tried and set aside rather than shipped
(translation-mods branch `fix/gold-save-overwrite-prompt-truncation`): it
isn't the corpus's own official phrasing, and singling out two languages
for a bespoke rewrite when the underlying defect is the engine's own
English source would just trade one inconsistency for another. All four
languages keep the same plain corpus-truncation compromise as English for
now, warts included, until the real fix below lands.

A real upstream fix would need `SaveMenu.lua`'s "overwrite" phase to gain
actual paging -- an intermediate state that shows the text and waits for an
A-press before the YES/NO box appears, mirroring the cart's
`AskOverwriteSaveFile` flow -- not just a `Strings()` wrap around the
existing two fixed lines. That is a real interaction-flow change (an extra
button press, for every language including English), materially bigger and
riskier than `fix/translate-gold-title-and-save-menus`'s Strings()-wrapping
scope, so it was deliberately left out of that branch. Not attempted yet.

**Stat-change and item/move status messages (10 entries, `overrides/<language>/gsc/engine.json`
for fr/es/it; 6 of the 10 also affected de) -- POKéMON name forced first by
the engine, not by the corpus:** `Effects.stageMessage()` and
`Battle:changeStage()`/`Battle.lua`'s disabled/activated/PP-reduction
messages all call `Strings(source, name, label)` with the POKéMON's own
name as the *first* `printf` argument, always -- but the real ROM's
fr/es/it localizations put the stat/move/item name *first* instead, joined
to the POKéMON name with "de"/"di" (`"<STAT> de <POKéMON> diminue !"`,
confirmed against poke-corpus GoldSilver directly, e.g.
`gs.common_2.BattleStatFellText`/`gs.battle.DisabledMoveText`). Lua's
`string.format` (the implementation behind `Strings.get()`,
`src/core/Strings.lua`) binds each `%s` to the *next* vararg in call order,
not by where it's written in the template, so that word order can never be
reproduced from a `Strings(source, name, label)` callsite -- only a
`Strings(source, label, name)` callsite (an upstream engine change) could.

An earlier revision of these entries assumed the wrong thing: that the
corpus simply had no match at all, and that name-then-stat was this
message's "own" argument order, matching engine siblings like `"%s's %s was
reduced by %d!"`. Direct verification against the real corpus found the
opposite: a real, validated match *does* exist, it's just unreachable given
the engine's fixed argument order -- and the previously-shipped `"%s's %s
won't rise anymore!"`/`"%s's %s won't drop anymore!"` entries (tagged
`engine-corpus`, i.e. claimed validated) had silently inherited the same
reversed word order from an automatic corpus match that only checks
placeholder *count*, not which runtime argument each placeholder is
semantically bound to -- shipping "POKéMON de STAT" instead of the corpus's
real "STAT de POKéMON". Found via a player report of `"HERICENDRE de
DEFENSE diminue!"` in a real French Gold/Silver build. All ten entries
below were rephrased to keep the engine's forced POKéMON-first order while
staying natural in each language, the same technique already used for
`"%s's %s\nrose!"` in the RBY table above.

German needed the smaller fix of the six: its real corpus phrasing for
plain fell/rose already puts the POKéMON name first via an attached
genitive `-s` (`"<POKéMON>s <STAT> sinkt!"`, matching the engine's argument
order exactly and already used correctly by this file's own
`"activated!"`/`"is DISABLED!"` entries) -- only `won't rise/drop anymore!`
used a reversed `"von"` construction and needed the same genitive-s
treatment. Japanese and Korean were never affected: their possessive
grammar (`の`/`의`) is head-first, so the corpus's own word order already
matches the engine's forced argument order.

For the plain fell/sharply fell/rose/sharply rose entries specifically,
checking RBY's own equivalent messages
(`MoveEffects.lua`'s `changeStage`, `rb.text_3.RoseText`/`FellText`/
`GreatlyRoseText`/`GreatlyFellText`) paid off differently per language:

- **fr**: RBY's real official corpus phrasing for this exact same
  semantic event is already POKéMON-first (`"<POKéMON>\ngagne <STAT>!"`/
  `"...perd <STAT>!"`) -- reused verbatim instead of the invented
  "voit sa ... diminuer/augmenter" phrasing from an earlier revision of
  this entry, since real official text beats an authored compromise
  whenever the two are compatible. Confirmed this project's own RBY build
  already ships exactly this text (`.cache/interactive/fr/mod/lang/strings.lua`).
- **es/it**: checked RBY's own es/it corpus for the same messages and
  found it reverses the exact same way GoldSilver's does (`"<STAT>
  de/di <POKéMON>..."`) -- so there is no compatible official phrasing to
  borrow here either. Aligned instead with this project's own existing
  editorial-compromise wording for the equivalent RBY messages
  (`overrides/es/rby/engine.json`'s `"¡%s\nsu %s subió/bajó!"`,
  `overrides/it/rby/engine.json`'s `"%s\n%s sale/cala!"`) rather than
  inventing a third, inconsistent phrasing for the same underlying event.
- **de**: unaffected by this reconsideration, already fixed above.

Fixed on `fix/gsc-stat-message-word-order`.

**A wider follow-up audit turned up five more instances of the same
underlying bug class**, this time in messages whose two dynamic entities
are attacker/target (not POKéMON/stat) -- confirming the automatic
matcher's blind spot (checks placeholder count, not which runtime
argument each one is semantically bound to) is not limited to the
POKéMON's-name-forced-first shape:

- **`"%s's hurt by %s!"`** (`Battle.lua:5126`, `Strings(source, monName,
  moveName)`, POKéMON first): de and it's real corpus reverses (`"<MOVE>
  schadet/ha effetto su <POKéMON>!"`, move first) -- previously shipped
  literally, reading "POKéMON schadet MOVE!"/"POKéMON ha effetto su
  MOVE!" (POKéMON hurts the move, backwards). Fixed to `de: "%s\nleidet
  unter\x0b%s!"` / `it: "%s\nsubisce\x0b%s!"` (fr/es/ja-Hrkt/ko were
  already POKéMON-first and correct).
- **`"%s used BIND on %s!"`** (`Battle.lua:2659`, `Strings(source, user,
  target)`, user first): de's real corpus reverses (`"<TARGET> erleidet
  Schaden durch <USER>s KLAMMERGRIFF!"`, target first) -- previously
  shipped literally, reading "<USER> erleidet Schaden durch <TARGET>s
  KLAMMERGRIFF!" (implying the user, not the target, is the one being
  bound). Fixed to `"%s\nhält %s\nmit KLAMMERGRIFF fest!"`.
- **`"%s was WRAPPED by %s!"`/`"%s was CLAMPED by %s!"`**
  (`Battle.lua:2662`/`2665`, `Strings(source, target, user)`, target
  first): it's real corpus uses active voice with the user first
  (`"<USER> ha usato AVVOLGIBOTTA/TENAGLIA su <TARGET>!"`) -- previously
  shipped literally, reading "<TARGET> ha usato .../su <USER>!" (implying
  the target, not the user, is doing the wrapping/clamping). Fixed to a
  passive construction that keeps the target first, matching this
  project's own fr/es/de overrides for the same messages:
  `"%s\nè avvolto da\x0b%s!"` / `"%s\nè stretto da\x0b%s!"`.
- **The Crystal PokéSeer trade-origin flavor line**
  (`"Hm… %s\ncame from %s\x0bin a trade?\x0c%s\nwas where %s\x0bmet
  %s!"`, `crystal_extras.lua:424`, `Strings(source, name, ot, place, ot,
  name)`, five arguments in a fixed `nickname, OT, location, OT,
  nickname` order): this is the worst instance found -- de/es/it's real
  Crystal corpus text reorders all five dynamic segments differently
  from English/fr (moving the location to the very end instead of the
  middle, and doubling up the OT/nickname mentions in a different
  sequence), so the previous overrides, which just quoted that reordered
  text positionally, produced genuinely incoherent output: wrong names
  and the wrong location in most of the five slots once substituted
  through the engine's fixed argument order. No compatible official
  phrasing existed to reuse (unlike the RBY-borrowing case above), so new
  sentences were composed for de/es/it using the same
  `nickname, OT, location, OT, nickname` order as English/fr:
  `de: "Hm… %s\nkam von %s\x0cim Tausch?\x0c%s\nwar, wo %s\x0c%s
  traf!"`, `es: "Hm… %s\nvino de %s\x0cen un intercambio?\x0c%s\nfue
  donde %s\x0cconoció a %s!"`, `it: "Hm… %s\nè arrivato da %s\x0ccon uno
  scambio?\x0c%s\nè dove %s\x0cha incontrato %s!"`.

The rest of `overrides/<language>/gsc/engine.json`'s ~40 remaining
two-or-more-argument entries were checked against poke-corpus GoldSilver/
Crystal too (sequential-narration shapes like `"%s sent out %s!"`, `"%s
identified %s!"`, `"%s TRANSFORMED into %s!"`, the PokéSeer's other
lines, and currency/number-only shapes like `"%s got %s%d for
winning!"`) and found already correctly ordered in every language --
these are messages where the two entities appear in the same relative
order across languages (an active-voice sentence with two different
POKéMON, or a name next to a plain number), so there was nothing to
translate incompatibly with the engine's fixed argument order in the
first place.

**A second pass extended the same corpus cross-referencing to
ja-Hrkt/ko** (only spot-checked for the first batch, on the theory that
their head-first possessive grammar makes them structurally immune --
true for every POKéMON/stat and POKéMON/item message, but not for
`"%s used BIND on %s!"`): both languages' real corpus phrasing for this
move is the same target-topic-first passive construction used for the
sibling WRAPPED/CLAMPED entries (`"<TARGET>は/는(은) <USER>に/에게
しめつけられた/조이기를 당했다!"`), which happens to match WRAPPED/
CLAMPED's `(target, user)` call order but not BIND's own `(user,
target)` call order (`Battle.lua:2659`) -- so both previously shipped
the attacker and the one being bound swapped, the same mistake as de's
BIND entry above. Rewritten as active-voice sentences that keep the
user first: `ja-Hrkt: "%sが %sに\nしめつけた！"`, `ko: "%s이(가)
%s를(을)\n조였다!"`.

Also checked (and found already correct) while this was open:
ja-Hrkt's existing five-argument PokéSeer trade-line override, which
turned out to already correctly adapt to the engine's `(nickname, OT,
location, OT, nickname)` call order (`"ふむ……\nこの%sは %sと\x0cこう
かんした POKéMONじゃな？\x0c%sで\n%sが %sと\x0bであった！"`,
provenance already recorded this as a deliberate adaptation) -- ko has
no override for that key at all yet (untranslated, a coverage gap
rather than a wrong-order bug, left alone).

Fixed on `fix/gsc-stat-message-word-order`.

### Required upstream capabilities

Still genuinely out of reach: these have no public hook at all, only a
hardcoded local table or a `self:say(...)`/`:drawBottomLines(...)` call, so
they must not be implemented by reaching into private UI classes.

Underlying most of the bullets below: RBY's `romText()`/`data.text[label]`
pairing -- the mechanism "Fixed upstream: more battle/overworld/menu
messages now routed through the real ROM text" above used to close 21
RBY gaps by pointing an existing `Strings()` compromise at its real ROM
label instead -- has **no Gold equivalent at all**. Confirmed directly:
nothing under `src/*/gen2/` (~110 files, 80k lines) calls
`romText()`/`require("src.core.RomText")` or reads `data.text[...]`, and
Gold's own ROM-text extractor (`import/RomExtractorGen2.lua`) keys
dialogue by bank:address (`Opcodes.key(bank, address)`), not by a named
pokered-style label the way RBY's extractor does -- so there is no
label-keyed table to route a Gold `Strings()` fallback through even in
principle. This is why Gold's remaining gaps below are not a small mirror
of the RBY fixes: introducing the pattern for Gold is new engine work, not
a matter of wiring a few missed callsites.

- **PC and storage dialogue -- fixed upstream, not attempted yet in a prior
  version of this doc.** `CenterPcMenu:buildEntries()` used to build its
  "which PC" list and free-form prompts directly, with no hook at all. Not
  true anymore: re-checked directly against the v0.2.51 checkout,
  `CenterPcMenu.lua` now wraps every one of these in `Strings()`/
  `Strings.source()` -- `BILL's PC`, `PROF.OAK's PC`, `HALL OF FAME`, the
  player-name template `%s's PC`, `TURN OFF`, `Access whose PC?`,
  `Want to get your\n#DEX rated?`, the link-closed messages and the
  `BILL's PC\naccessed....`/`PROF.OAK's PC\naccessed....` openings all now
  reach `mod.content.strings:override`, the same general hook every other
  engine string uses -- no `ui.pc.items`/`literal_handlers.json` special
  case needed. Confirmed live: a real French build's `lang/strings.lua`
  carries all of them translated (`"PC DE LEO"`, `"PC DE CHEN"`,
  `"CELEBRITE"`, `"PC DE %s"`, `"DECONNEXION"`, ...), most resolved fully
  automatically by the existing corpus matcher, same as any other engine
  key. `BoxMenu.lua` is the same story: also fully `Strings()`-wrapped now,
  and most of its rows already auto-translate (`Choose a <PK><MN>.`,
  `CANCEL`, `PARTY <PK><MN>`, `MOVE`, `DEPOSIT`, `What's up?`,
  `Move to where?`), but not all of them -- `Choose a BOX.`, `STATS`,
  `WITHDRAW` and `RELEASE` remain unresolved gen2 engine keys as of this
  writing, worth a dedicated pass. Box names (`BOX1`, `BOX2`, …) are still a
  different case, unaffected by any of this: not a menu string at all, but
  save data written once by `SetDefaultBoxNames` when a new save is created
  (`core/gen2/Boxes.lua`'s `save.boxNames`), so they would still need a
  save-init hook, not a menu-list one.
- **Battle action menu -- fixed upstream.** The `FIGHT`/`<PK><MN>`/`PACK`/
  `RUN` 2x2 grid used to be a hardcoded local table in `ui/gen2/BattleState.lua`
  with no hook at all. Re-checked directly against v0.2.51: the table
  (`local MENU = { Strings.source("FIGHT"), ... }`) is now built from
  `Strings.source()`, and rendered through a real `Strings(MENU[i])` call
  (`ui/gen2/BattleState.lua:4179-4184`) -- the same general `strings`
  override hook as everything else. `PACK` was already auto-matching by the
  time this was checked; `FIGHT` and `RUN` needed a manual pick because the
  corpus packs all four labels into one segmented row
  (`gs.menu.BattleMenuHeader.Text`, `@`-joined) rather than one row per
  label -- closed this session by picking segment 0/3 directly (safe across
  all six languages: only the interior `<PK><MN>`/`PACK` segment order
  differs between languages, not the FIGHT/RUN endpoints), verified against
  a real build (`fr`: `"ATTAQ"`/`"FUITE"`). `overrides/<lang>/gsc/
  engine.json`'s `"FIGHT"`/`"RUN"` entries record the pick.

  **Corrected from a prior version of this doc:** the rest of this bullet
  used to list `Wild Pokémon appeared!`, `Pokémon's defense rose`,
  `Pokémon learned …`, `Got away safely`, `Pokémon's attack missed`, `…
  wants to battle`, `… sent out …`, `A critical hit`, and `You have no
  more Pokémon` as needing a brand-new public string/event registry. That
  doesn't hold: `src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua` already `require`s and uses
  `Strings()` (e.g. `Strings("%s\nused %s!", ...)`) -- the hook exists.
  The real gap is that the large majority of this file's combat messages
  (100+ lines) build their text by raw string concatenation instead,
  bypassing that existing hook one message at a time, not because a hook
  is missing. `Pokémon's defense rose` (`EFFECT_REFLECT`) and its
  undocumented `EFFECT_LIGHT_SCREEN` sibling (`SPCL.DEF rose!`) are fixed
  upstream (gen1recomp branch `fix/stat-rise-message-translation`, merged,
  PR #1439); the rest of `gen2/Battle.lua`'s
  messages, including the ones still named above, need the same
  treatment -- wrapping each one in `Strings(...)`, message by message. A
  real chunk of work by volume, but not a design gap.
- **Status condition abbreviations (Gold):** unlike RBY (pending fix
  above), all three Gold screens that draw a status abbreviation
  (`ui/gen2/PartyMenu.lua:672-678`, `ui/gen2/SummaryMenu.lua:208`,
  `ui/gen2/BattleState.lua:3401-3402`) each derive it their own way --
  `ItemEffects.STATUS_CLASS` lookups or a hardcoded local table -- none
  reads `hudLabel`/`label` from the merged `statuses` registry the way
  RBY's fix will. Not a small mirror of the RBY fix: it needs all
  three call sites rewritten, not one lookup swapped in. This project's own
  `status_labels` catalog (`pipeline/gs_mod.py`'s `status_label_catalog()`,
  patched via `mod.content.statuses:patch(id, { label = value })`, same
  mechanism as RBY's) already exists and ships translated -- the gap is
  entirely upstream, waiting on those three Gold call sites to read from the
  merged registry the way RBY's fixed screens now do.
- **Gen2 Pokédex screen:** expose the Gen2 Pokédex text and its `START` /
  `SELECT` / `OPTION` / `SEARCH` labels through a public registry. The mod can
  generate species and Pokédex catalogs, but the current screen reads a
  separate internal `data.gen2Pokedex` table, which is why the in-game entry
  can be blank.
- **Pokegear "Press any button to exit":** still needs a public hook -- this
  one line is not covered by the fix below.
- **Gold in-game Options menu (from gen1recomp#1642, fixed upstream):**
  `src/ui/gen2/OptionsMenu.lua` had zero `Strings()` calls anywhere in the
  file -- confirmed directly against a real v0.2.19 checkout. Every row
  label (`TEXT SPEED`, `BATTLE SCENE`, `BATTLE STYLE`, `SOUND`, `PRINT`,
  `MENU ACCOUNT`, `FRAME`, `CONTROLS`, `MUSIC VOL`, `SFX VOL`, `MUSIC
  FILTER`, `GAME SPEED`, `ZOOM`, `VOID FILL`, `TILT`, `COLOR`, `GBC FX`,
  `VIDEO MODE`, `SCREEN POS`, `TOUCH PAD`, `TOUCH LAYOUT`, `VIBRATION`, and
  each row's own value strings like `FAST`/`MID`/`SLOW`, `ON`/`OFF`,
  `SHIFT`/`SET`, `MONO`/`STEREO`) was a plain Lua table field, drawn with
  `Chrome.print(row.label, 2, labelY)` -- no hook for a mod to reach any of
  it. This was the screen behind the issue's "the options... phrase"
  report. Fixed upstream on gen1recomp branch
  `fix/translate-gold-options-menu` (labels and cart-original values wrapped
  in `Strings()`/`Strings.source()`, mirroring the Gen 1 OPTION screen's own
  pattern), merged to `dev` as PR #1735 (`6b6b8f46`). This project's own
  `overrides/{fr,de,es,it}/gold/engine.json` already carry real corpus
  values for every one of these labels and value ladders (branch
  `feat/gold-options-menu-corpus-translations`, merged to `main` as PR #34)
  -- checked directly against poke-corpus (`gs.options_menu.StringOptions`
  and its `Options_*` rows) and they match the ROM's English source
  character-for-character, padding included, so this is official localized
  phrasing, not a compromise. Live as of gen1recomp v0.2.24 (`aea38240`):
  that release includes PR #1735, so a build from the pin shows this screen
  translated. **Corrected from a prior version of this doc:** ja-Hrkt/ko
  were listed here as unresolved because their corpus rows supposedly used
  `<NEXT>` instead of `<LF>`. Re-checked directly: none of the relevant
  rows use `<NEXT>` at all, and `YOUR NAME?`/`RIVAL'S NAME?`/`MOTHER'S
  NAME?`/`BOX NAME?` (naming screen, below) and the save-flow prompts all
  now resolve automatically from real corpus text for both languages, no
  override needed. `OPTION` is the one exception: without an explicit
  override, ja-Hrkt/ko's own automatic match picks a different, truncated
  corpus row (just "settings" as a noun, missing the verb half of the
  packed CONTINUE/NEW GAME/OPTION/MYSTERY GIFT segment) -- `overrides/
  {ja-Hrkt,ko}/gsc/engine.json` carry an explicit pick for that one key.
  ja-Hrkt also needs one for two of the SAVE-screen prompts below: its own
  automatic match substitutes a spelled-out "POKé" for the ROM's own
  literal "#" glyph.

  **Future architectural note:** every one of these labels and value ladders
  is verbatim cart text, which argues for routing this screen through real
  ROM extraction (a `game.data.text`-equivalent table gen1recomp's own
  extractor would fill from *whatever* ROM is imported) rather than
  `Strings()` plus a hand-maintained override per language -- the same shift
  already made for RBY content that used to need this project's manual
  overrides. Done that way, a player who imports their own localized Gold
  cartridge would see this screen in their own language even with no
  translation mod installed at all, and this project's override table above
  would become unnecessary. That is a gen1recomp-side change (extending
  `RomExtractorGen2.lua` plus rewriting `OptionsMenu.lua` to read from it),
  materially bigger than the `Strings()`-wrapping fix already on
  `fix/translate-gold-options-menu`; deferred for now.
- **Gold naming/keyboard screen (from gen1recomp#1642, fixed upstream):**
  `src/ui/gen2/NamingScreen.lua` also had zero `Strings()` calls. The
  prompts (`YOUR NAME?`, `RIVAL'S NAME?`, `MOTHER'S NAME?`, `BOX NAME?`,
  `NICKNAME?`), the on-screen keyboard's own letters, and the
  `lower`/`UPPER`/`DEL`/`END` bottom row were all raw literals, drawn
  directly (`Chrome.printThrough("NICKNAME?", 5, 4, pal)` and similar) with
  no public hook. Matches the issue's "the writing custom game is empty"
  report (the character/nickname naming screen). Fixed upstream on
  gen1recomp branch `fix/translate-gold-naming-screen`, mirroring the Gen 1
  naming screen's own `Strings(cell)`-per-keyboard-cell pattern, merged to
  `dev` as PR #1738 (`41790637`). Also live as of gen1recomp v0.2.24, same
  as the Options menu entry above.

  A second, more severe bug turned up investigating this same report: with
  a translation mod's TTF font active, this screen's on-screen keyboard
  rendered *no text at all* (only a dashed placeholder line), independently
  of the `Strings()` gap above -- see "Engine bugs surfaced by TTF mode"
  below, which covers the real root cause and its fix.
- **Received-item/system rewards: fixed, but on this project's own side, not
  gen1recomp's.** Confirmed with a real in-game boot (fr): both the
  Pokégear grant ("reçoit .", `gs.std_text.ReceivedItemText`) and the
  Cyndaquil/Héricendre starter grant ("reçoit !",
  `gs.ElmsLab.ReceivedStarterText`) showed an empty substituted name, with
  the surrounding sentence correctly translated.

  **Corrected from a prior version of this doc:** this used to be listed
  here as needing an unmerged gen1recomp fix
  (`fix/gold-empty-item-mon-name-fallback`, making `getMonName`/
  `getItemName` in `src/world/gen2/World.lua` require `def.name ~= ""`
  instead of a bare truth test). That branch, dated the day before the fix
  below, was an initial, since-superseded theory of the root cause -- it is
  still sitting unmerged on gen1recomp and is not needed to close this gap.
  The actual root cause, found the next day by dumping the engine's own
  cached extracted text at runtime: the raw pointer text for both events is
  bare and correct, but the *generated translation* itself shipped a token
  (`{RAM:wStringBuffer4}`/`{RAM:wStringBuffer3}`) that
  `gen1recomp`'s own `TextBox.lua` `RAM` handler does not recognise (it only
  matches the bare `wStringBuffer`/`wNameBuffer` spellings for Gold, not a
  numbered one), which `Tokens.expand` then silently drops -- a pipeline
  bug, not an engine one. Fixed entirely on this project's side:
  `pipeline/tokens.py`'s `corpus_to_engine` gained an opt-in
  `bare_dynamic_tokens` flag that Gold's call sites now pass, collapsing
  `{text_ram X}`/`{text_decimal X}`/`{text_bcd X}` to the bare
  `{STRBUF}`/`{NUM}` markers Gold's engine-side decoder actually produces;
  merged as PR #37 (`fix/gold-strbuf-buffer-number-token`). No gen1recomp
  change needed, and no pin bump either -- this fix lives entirely in this
  project's own Python pipeline.
- **Item descriptions and summary/stat labels:** expose the bag item
  descriptions and the remaining Pokémon summary labels (`Level up`, `EXP
  Points`, `Type`, `Item`, `Move`, `OT`, `Attack`, `Defense`, and related
  screens) through public data or hooks.

The entries in `config/gsc/literal_handlers.json` record known stable corpus
matches for menu screens exposed through `ui.pc.items`/`ui.start_menu.items`/
`ui.title_menu.items`/`ui.options.rows`/`ui.party.submenu` -- deliberately not
a private-class monkey patch. **Already active, not merely recorded for
later:** `pipeline/gs_mod.py`'s `_gs_ui_labels()` reads this
file and ships every entry through the `ui_labels` catalog today, wired into
those five hooks -- this is not a future activation step. Some of the file's
entries (`FIGHT`, `PACK`, `RUN`, `BILL's PC`, `PROF.OAK's PC`, `TURN OFF`,
...) turned out to be redundant duplicates once the screens that actually
render them (`CenterPcMenu`, `BoxMenu`, the battle action menu) were
confirmed to route through a plain `Strings()` call instead -- reachable
through the general `strings`/`engine.json` catalog on its own, with no need
for the `ui_labels` path at all; see "PC and storage dialogue" and "Battle
action menu" above. This keeps the release manifest permission-free either
way and makes any screen still genuinely without a hook (the remaining
bullets above) visible to the engine project.

## Engine bugs surfaced by TTF mode (not translation gaps)

Three unrelated gen1recomp bugs, all only visible once a mod activates TTF
text mode (`mod.content.font:register("ttf", ...)`), translated or not --
none fixable from a mod, since none had a hook into the broken code. All
three are merged upstream.

- **ManagerState white-on-white:** reported by a user (fr, Fusion Pixel
  profile): the in-game Mod Manager screen (`src/mods/ManagerState.lua`)
  showed no text at all, everything white -- invisible on the vanilla
  tile font, whose glyphs are always black-on-transparent regardless of
  the current draw color. Root cause: `ManagerState:draw()`/
  `drawOverlay()` set white before their `Font.drawBox` call and never
  reset to black afterward, unlike every other screen that calls
  `Font.drawBox` (`TitleState.lua`, `StartMenu.lua`, `HallOfFame.lua`,
  `BoxMenu.lua`, `PartyMenu.lua`). Fixed on gen1recomp
  `fix/manager-state-draw-color` (merged, PR #1426, `b20b1370`): both call
  sites now reset to black right after `Font.drawBox`, matching every other
  screen.
- **Fragmented glyphs on Android:** a mod's custom TTF font rendered
  correctly on Windows but came out fragmented (strokes dropped, doubled,
  or interrupted) on Android, while ROM tile glyphs stayed sharp. Root
  cause: the in-game renderer draws into a pixel-exact `dpiscale = 1`
  canvas, but TTF fonts were created with no explicit DPI scale, so LÖVE
  rasterized them at the Android window's (higher) density and the result
  got resampled back down, distorting one-pixel strokes. Fixed on
  gen1recomp `fix/android-ttf-dpi` (merged, PR #1042): TTF fonts are now
  created with an explicit `dpiscale = 1`, matching the game canvas; the
  existing ROM-tile fallback on load failure is unchanged. Verified with a
  translation mod on an Android emulator: glyphs render cleanly after the
  fix.
- **Naming screen, Diploma and Pokegear text going blank:** reported and
  reproduced against a real Gold build running this project's fr mod: with
  the TTF font active, the naming/keyboard screen's on-screen keyboard
  rendered no text at all (only a dashed placeholder line where the letters
  should be); without the mod (vanilla, tile font), the same screen
  rendered correctly. Traced to `Chrome.printThrough`
  (`src/ui/gen2/Chrome.lua`), the shared routine every non-white-background
  Gold screen (naming screen, Diploma, Pokegear, Credits) draws its text
  through: it runs every glyph through a shader that recovers a shade from
  the RED CHANNEL of an already-rasterized 2bpp tile pixel
  (`src/render/GbcPalette.lua`'s `SHADER_SOURCE`), which assumes the
  texture underneath is one of the four flat GB shades. A TTF glyph is not:
  LÖVE's font rasterizer stores glyph coverage as alpha over a plain white
  texture and lets the current tint carry the ink colour, so that same
  red-channel read always comes back 1.0 -- shade 0 -- painting every TTF
  character the exact colour of the paper rect `printThrough` had just
  drawn behind it: invisible. Gen 1 has no such shader, which is why the
  same mod draws fine there. Fixed upstream on gen1recomp branch
  `fix/gold-ttf-printthrough-invisible-text` (a TTF glyph skips the shader
  entirely and is tinted with the palette's own ink colour directly,
  switched per glyph so a string that mixes tile-based ligatures like
  `<PK>`/`<MN>` with TTF-drawn letters still gets both right), merged to
  `dev` as PR #1736 (`4ab0ac43`).

## Build tooling bugs in `tools/modkit.py` on Windows (not translation gaps)

Two unrelated Windows-only encoding bugs in gen1recomp's own
`tools/modkit.py` (vendored, not this project's code), both hit while
running or validating a translation mod.

### Fixed upstream: dumped text crash when it isn't representable in the system codepage

`dump_dataset()` (and two similar call sites, `run_loader()`'s loader
driver and `check_data_dump()`'s dump check) called `subprocess.run(...,
capture_output=True, text=True)` with no explicit `encoding=`, so Python
fell back to the OS locale's default codepage -- on Windows, always a
legacy single-byte codepage, never UTF-8. A LuaJIT dump byte with no
mapping in that codepage (e.g. `”` U+201D, whose UTF-8 trailing byte
`0x9D` is undefined in cp1252) crashed `subprocess.communicate()`'s
internal reader thread silently, leaving `.stdout` as `None` and the
caller crashing one line later with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object
has no attribute 'splitlines'`. Verified reproducible today: the real
Yellow-imported dataset's `_ColosseumHeightText` row contains exactly
this byte, so scaffolding/refreshing a Yellow-aware translation on
Windows hit this reliably; the Red/Blue-only dump has zero occurrences.
Fixed on gen1recomp `fix/modkit-dump-dataset-utf8-decode` (merged,
PR #996): all three call sites now pass `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly,
matching the UTF-8 the dumps are actually produced in.

### Still open: `modkit pack` fails on a non-ASCII Windows path

Two independent Windows users reported the GUI's build failing with only
"Command failed with exit code 1" and a `modkit.py ... pack ...` command
line -- no other detail (the GUI not showing the command's own captured
output was a separate, real gap, since fixed). One report's path was
`D:\Jeux\Fan Made Pokémon\Gen1 Recomp\...`; the other reproduced it
directly by picking `Downloads\ééé` as the output directory. Both point at
the same thing: an accented character anywhere in the working tree
`modkit.py pack` runs from.

**Root cause, traced through `tools/modkit.py` (gen1recomp, vendored --
not this project's own code):** `cmd_pack` calls `run_loader(repo, mod_dir,
...)` to validate the mod by actually booting it under LuaJIT headlessly.
`run_loader` builds a map of every mod file to its absolute filesystem path
(`files[f"{mount}/{rel}"] = os.path.join(mod_dir, rel)`), embeds that map as
Lua string literals into a generated driver script
(`entries = "".join("  [%s] = %s,\n" % (lua_quote(k), lua_quote(v)) ...)`),
writes it as a UTF-8 text file (`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile("w", ...,
encoding="utf-8")`), and runs it with
`subprocess.run([LUAJIT, driver_path], cwd=repo, ...)`. The driver then
`io.open`s those paths to actually load the mod's files.

LuaJIT (like standard Lua) has no concept of source-file text encoding for
string literals: the bytes between the quotes in the driver script --
UTF-8 bytes, since Python wrote the file as UTF-8 -- become the runtime
string's bytes verbatim. On Windows, `io.open` reaches the C runtime's
narrow `fopen()`, which interprets those bytes against the **active ANSI
codepage**, not UTF-8. UTF-8's two-byte encoding of "é" (`0xC3 0xA9`)
decoded as a Windows-1252-family codepage does not round-trip back to "é"
-- the resulting filename does not exist on disk, `io.open` fails, the Lua
driver errors out, LuaJIT exits non-zero, and `run_loader` reports it as
`Finding("MK100", "error", "loader driver crashed: ...")`, which `cmd_pack`
treats as fatal (exit code 1) -- matching both reports exactly.

Not fixable from this project: the failure is inside gen1recomp's own
`tools/modkit.py` driving LuaJIT, not in anything this mod's pipeline
generates or controls. Two realistic upstream fixes, neither requiring a
LuaJIT rebuild:

- Convert `mod_dir`'s absolute path to its Windows short (8.3) name (always
  pure ASCII) via `ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetShortPathNameW` before
  embedding it in the driver script. Requires 8.3 name generation to be
  enabled for the volume, which is the Windows default but can be turned
  off.
- Copy the mod tree into an ASCII-safe temporary directory before invoking
  LuaJIT for this check, sidestepping the encoding mismatch entirely
  regardless of where the real mod directory lives.

This project's own workaround is narrower and does not depend on an
upstream fix: the GUI no longer roots its working directory (where
gen1recomp is cloned and the mod is actually built and packed) inside the
user's chosen *output* directory, since that is the more commonly
non-ASCII one (a deep, descriptively-named project folder picked via a
file browser, as in both reports) -- it now stays anchored near the
executable, matching what the CLI already did by default. That does not
fully close the gap (the executable's own launch location, or a
non-ASCII Windows username, can still trigger this), which is why it is
recorded here rather than closed.
