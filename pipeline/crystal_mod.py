"""Join Pokémon Crystal's extracted dialogue against poke-corpus.

Crystal shares Gold/Silver's `tools/gs_extract.lua` extractor contract (the
extractor's own edition branches, and gen1recomp's `RomExtractorGen2.lua`
underneath it, already cover "crystal") and its normalized-English-text join
strategy (`pipeline.gs_join.join_gs_pointers` matches by text, not by
pointer, so it is edition-agnostic despite its "gs_" name) -- but Crystal's
own `bank:address` pointers diverge substantially from Gold/Silver's (95.8%
of shared symbol names have a different address, measured directly against
real ROMs), so it needs its own corpus join against poke-corpus's separate
`Crystal/` collection rather than reusing Gold/Silver's own resolved
catalog. Crystal's qid namespace (`c.*`) mirrors GoldSilver's own rich
per-context taxonomy (e.g. `c.common_2.BouldersMayMoveText`,
`c.RadioTower3F.GruntM7BeatenText`) -- same per-map/per-context structure,
same trailing symbol names, just a `c.` prefix instead of `gs.`, not a flat
namespace and no overlap with `gs.*` itself.

Crystal ships as a mandatory companion catalog merged into the same mod as
Gold/Silver (see pipeline/gs_mod.py's build_gs()/generate_gs_mod()), applied
at runtime only when Crystal's engine capability is present -- the same pattern
pipeline/mod.py's RBY build uses for Yellow's own dialogue_yellow.lua layer,
just without a large pointer-identical "free" majority to lean on (unlike
Yellow vs Red/Blue).

Scope: dialogue text only. No named catalogs (species/moves/items/trainer
classes -- likely reusable from Gold/Silver's own translated values, since
the roster is the same generation, but not yet verified or wired up), no
engine-string catalog (the Options/Menu `Strings()` catalog is literally the
same shared Lua code across gold/silver/crystal, so Crystal saves already
get it for free from Gold/Silver's own `overrides/<lang>/gsc/engine.json` --
nothing Crystal-specific needed there), and no release gates.

    """Load reviewed Crystal pointer-to-corpus-QID decisions.

    Mirrors pipeline.gs_join.load_gs_pointer_decisions() exactly, except the
    qid prefix it validates is "c." (Crystal's own corpus namespace) instead
    of "gs.". Kept as a separate function, not a shared one with a
    configurable prefix, so a stray Gold-side edit can't accidentally start
    accepting Crystal qids or vice versa.

    Decisions select corpus rows rather than carrying translated prose, so
    one review applies consistently to every target language. Every entry
    here was mechanically derived (not hand-picked one by one), from two
    sources:

    - A first pass reused Gold's own already-reviewed
      config/gsc/pointer_decisions.json: when a Crystal pointer's ambiguous
      candidates included exactly one qid whose "gs."-prefixed counterpart
      Gold's reviewers already picked as the real, reachable text over its
      sibling candidates (typically a std_text.Unused* duplicate), the same
      suffix was picked here too -- Crystal reuses the same per-location qid
      taxonomy, so a candidate Gold's own review never needed for a real
      pointer is reliably dead/unreachable text in Crystal as well.
    - A second pass resolved the rest against ground truth: the
      pokecrystal disassembly (https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) builds
      byte-for-byte identical to the real retail ROM (verified: both hash to
      f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133), so its own linker-generated
      .sym file is an authoritative bank:address -> real ASM symbol name
      map. For each still-ambiguous pointer, the candidate whose qid
      suffix (stripped of a leading "_", pokecrystal's own local-label
      convention) matches that pointer's one real symbol is correct by
      construction, not inferred from corpus content -- this is not
      building or shipping pokecrystal, just consulting its own linker
      output once to generate this static, checked-in decision list.

    Together these resolved every one of the 113 pointers that were
    genuinely ambiguous (two-plus candidate qids, non-identical
    translations) as of the corpus/engine revisions this file was last
    regenerated against; a future corpus update could introduce new
    ambiguous pointers this file doesn't cover yet, which join_gs_pointers()
    reports as UNRESOLVED same as before this file existed.
