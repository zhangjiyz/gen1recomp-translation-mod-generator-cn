"""Gold's text catalog: bank:address pointers, not TEXT_* labels.

Parsed from tools/gs_extract.lua's gs_text.tsv/gs_labels.tsv output,
not from a real data/generated/text.lua: this project's Gold import
deliberately neuters RomExtractorGen2:write/:save (see
tools/gs_extract.lua's module docstring), so there is no such file on
disk to parse. gs_text.tsv IS the Gold equivalent of RBY's text.lua for
this pipeline's purposes -- see pipeline/yellow.py:parse_text_catalog for
the RBY-side parser this mirrors, adapted for Gold's pointer keys
(Schemas.GEN2.text routes to "gen2Text"; ids are ROM pointer strings like
"55:4067", not TEXT_* names -- docs/mod-api-gen2-compat.md).

Text only: this module carries no other registry (pokemon/moves/items/...
are out of this slice).

Also the single source for normalise()/unescape()/split_lines(): the
corpus<->pointer join primitives tools/measure_join.py measured this
backlog's go/no-go with, and pipeline/gs_join.py's join reuses verbatim
so the shipped join and the measurement stay the same code.
