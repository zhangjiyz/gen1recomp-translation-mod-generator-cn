# Gen1Recomp translation mod generator

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

This repository reproducibly generates multilingual `Gen1Recomp` translation
mods without storing a ROM or ROM extract. It currently produces two separate
artifacts per language:

- a universal Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow mod, with a runtime-selected Yellow
  layer;
- a Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal mod for Gen1Recomp's generation-2 runtime.

The artifacts have distinct mod IDs and filenames, so they can be installed
side by side.

> **AI-assisted development disclosure:** The repository and pipeline were
> developed with AI assistance. Changes are checked through automated tests,
> generated-artifact validation, and code review.

## Quick start

### Simplified Chinese seed build (no ROM required)

The reviewed Simplified Chinese catalogs can be repackaged without a ROM.
Crystal pointers come from pret/pokecrystal's public linker symbol table, not
from game data. Download the pinned symbol file and build both ZIPs:

```sh
curl -L --fail \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/cc6fc04f19c645f5c40f64f8d88b2ab42c7bdde8/pokecrystal.sym \
  -o /tmp/pokecrystal.sym
shasum -a 256 /tmp/pokecrystal.sym
# Must print: 697fe20b3c659273a3ab8aa85db2eb78dcf674a3dd17c98b52fc1dddd37783f2
python3 tools/build_zh_seed_mods.py \
  --gen1recomp ../Gen1RecompCN \
  --crystal-symbols /tmp/pokecrystal.sym
```

This is the normal Simplified Chinese edit/repack path. The interactive
ROM-backed builder remains available as an optional stronger audit when
upstream pointer tables or registry ids change; it is not required just to
produce the Mod ZIP files.

### PotatoVoxel localization bridge (no ROM required)

PotatoVoxel renders a small set of labels directly, so its source needs a
bridge that routes those labels through Gen1Recomp's `Strings(...)` catalog.
Build the reviewed bridge from the pinned official upstream revision:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel.git /tmp/potato_voxel
git -C /tmp/potato_voxel checkout a4675f9017c78a3a00bbefe389f1bc33ec4c1394
python3 tools/build_potato_zh_mod.py \
  --source /tmp/potato_voxel \
  --gen1recomp ../Gen1RecompCN
```

This writes `dist/potato_voxel-1.9.4-main-a4675f9-zh-hans.zip`. Install it
alongside `translation-zh-hans-0.8.0.zip` for Red/Blue/Yellow or
`translation-zh-hans-gen2-0.8.0.zip` for Gold/Silver/Crystal. The PotatoVoxel
ZIP contains the localization call sites; the two translation ZIPs provide
the 68 reviewed Simplified Chinese catalog entries.

### Recommended: use the graphical application

Download the GUI executable for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/thibautbus/gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator/releases/latest),
then select the target games and the corresponding ROM dumps:

![Gen1Recomp translation mod generator GUI](docs/gui.png)

1. Red, Blue and Yellow, or Gold and Silver;
2. your own canonical US ROM dumps for the selected games;
3. the target language and output directory.

The GUI writes a ready-to-import ZIP into the selected directory. It bundles
Python, Pillow and LuaJIT; network access is still required to download the
pinned Gen1Recomp and PokeCorpus inputs.

### Build from source with the CLI

Install Python 3.11+, Git, LuaJIT (`sudo apt install luajit` on
Ubuntu/Debian or `brew install luajit` on macOS), and Pillow
(`python -m pip install Pillow`). The builder checks prerequisites and prints
an installation hint; it never installs software silently. If LuaJIT is not
on `PATH`, set `MODKIT_LUAJIT` to its full executable path (it is a native
executable, not a Python package).

From the repository root:

```sh
python build_translation.py
```

Latin builds default to Fusion Pixel. Use
`python build_translation.py --font-profile pokemon` to select the optional
Pokemon Font profile. Substitute `python3`, `py -3`, or a virtual-environment
interpreter when appropriate.

The builder asks for the target games, canonical US ROM dumps and language. It
verifies the ROM fingerprints, asks before downloading pinned dependencies,
then extracts, translates, validates and packages the selected release in a
private ignored workspace.

The final file is `dist/translation-<lang>-<version>.zip` for RBY or
`dist/translation-<lang>-gen2-<version>.zip` for Gold and Silver; the command prints its
absolute path.

### Optional local path configuration

Copy [`config/rom_paths.example.toml`](config/rom_paths.example.toml) to the
ignored `config/rom_paths.toml` and edit it:

```toml
[rom]
red = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonRed.gb"
blue = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonBlue.gb"
yellow = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonYellow.gb"
gold = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonGold.gbc"
silver = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonSilver.gbc"
crystal = "/absolute/path/to/PokemonCrystal.gbc"
```

The three RBY entries are required for the universal build; either `gold` or
`silver`, plus `crystal`, is required for the generation-2 build (the prompt
accepts Gold and Silver interchangeably for the shared layer). Relative paths
resolve from this file and `~` expands, although
absolute paths are recommended. On Windows, use forward slashes or TOML
single-quoted paths such as `red = 'C:\Games\PokemonRed.gb'`. Configured files
are still checked for existence and SHA-1; declining one returns to the normal
prompt.

## Universal Yellow support

One ZIP per language works on Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow US. Red/Blue data
lives in the common catalogs; entries whose source or translation differs in
Yellow are emitted into `lang/*_yellow.lua` and applied only when
`GameVersion.isYellow()`. Building it only needs a real Red *or* Blue ROM
(whichever one is supplied) plus a real Yellow ROM: Red and Blue share
byte-identical dialogue text and pointer tables, so either extracts into an
equally correct build.

Shared translations are not duplicated. Missing matches keep the appropriate
ROM English text. The generated coverage report and
`.cache/audit/yellow/<language>.json` retain the full shared/versioned/Yellow-only
breakdown. Yellow-specific manual translations live in
`overrides/<language>/rby/yellow_engine.json`.

## Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal support

Gold, Silver and Crystal are published together as `translation-<lang>-gen2`. Gold's
and Silver's own text is built and extracted from either a real Gold or a real
Silver ROM (whichever one is supplied) and covers dialogue, Pokédex entries,
named ROM catalogs and engine strings matched from production Gen 2 callsites.
For corpus-based languages, Crystal is a mandatory companion ROM in the
interactive extraction/audit path. Its own dialogue text uses different `bank:address` pointers from
Gold/Silver (95.8% of shared symbol names diverge), so it gets its own corpus
join against poke-corpus's separate `Crystal/` collection and ships as a
`lang/dialogue_crystal.lua` layer, applied only at runtime on an actual Crystal
save. Crystal reuses Gold/Silver's own engine-string catalog as-is (the
Options/Menu `Strings()` code is identical across all three editions) and has
no named ROM catalogs of its own yet (species/moves/items/trainer classes).
Simplified Chinese instead uses the reviewed seed plus the pinned public
linker symbol table described above, so its normal repack does not require a
ROM. Korean has no Crystal corpus in poke-corpus, unlike Gold/Silver -- Crystal's
own dialogue simply stays in English for that language. Missing or ambiguous
matches remain in English. The manifest declares `"gold"`, `"silver"` and
`"crystal"` as supported games, so the same mod loads on any of the three
editions' saves.

Before packaging, headless generation-2 gates verify that the translated
values reach the Gold and Silver registries (Crystal's own dialogue layer is
not yet covered by a release gate). These checks do not replace an in-game
smoke test before release.

## Legal inputs and privacy

Use dumps from your own original US cartridges:

| Game | Expected SHA-1 |
| --- | --- |
| Red | `ea9bcae617fdf159b045185467ae58b2e4a48b9a` |
| Blue | `d7037c83e1ae5b39bde3c30787637ba1d4c48ce2` |
| Yellow | `cc7d03262ebfaf2f06772c1a480c7d9d5f4a38e1` |
| Gold | `d8b8a3600a465308c9953dfa04f0081c05bdcb94` |
| Silver | `49b163f7e57702bc939d642a18f591de55d92dae` |
| Crystal | `f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133` |

The pipeline verifies these fingerprints and never downloads, provides or
redistributes ROMs, patches or copyrighted text extracts. Generated data,
worksheets and reports remain under ignored `.cache/` paths and are not
packaged. Keep ROMs and the ignored `config/rom_paths.toml` private.

## Languages and fonts

English is the source language and runtime fallback. Supported targets and
font profiles are:

| Target languages | Releases | Default font | Optional font |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it` | RBY, Gold/Silver/Crystal | Fusion Pixel Latin, 10px | Pokemon Font, 8px |
| `ja-Hrkt` | RBY, Gold/Silver/Crystal | Fusion Pixel Japanese, 8px | — |
| `zh-Hans` | RBY and Gold/Silver reviewed seeds; Crystal workbook seed with conservative runtime join | Fusion Pixel Simplified Chinese, 10px | — |
| `ko` | Gold/Silver/Crystal only (Crystal's own dialogue stays in English) | Fusion Pixel Hangul, 10px | — |

The optional Pokemon Font is more compact, but translated text can still
overflow fixed-width interfaces.
Macros and interface chrome remain tile-rendered. Each mod packages only the
selected TTF and its applicable license notices.

The Simplified Chinese target starts from the reviewed catalogs under
[`seeds/zh-Hans`](seeds/zh-Hans). The seed importer excludes the old package's
entry point, manifest, font and validation claims, then verifies every imported
catalog by SHA-256 so current packaging and gates can be rebuilt against the
pinned engine. The `gsc-gs` seed contains 5,157 source-labelled Crystal rows
converted from a pinned `text.xlsx`. The private build emits only unique
matches or ambiguities whose Chinese result is identical; placeholder
mismatches and unresolved text stay English. The source repositories named by
the seed notices did not provide an explicit redistribution license, so public
release requires permission from their translation authors. See
[`docs/zh-Hans-localization-plan.md`](docs/zh-Hans-localization-plan.md) for the
current inventory, gates and remaining acceptance work.

## Translation coverage

### Red, Blue and Yellow

The ZIP is universal, but ROM coverage is reported separately for Red/Blue
and Yellow:

- `Red Blue ROM aggregate` is the release metric. It combines the six effective ROM
  catalogs (dialogue, species/move/item/trainer names, status labels) with a
  handful of shared runtime entries (types, species kinds, literal handlers,
  demo names and ROM-derived engine templates): `3286` for Red/Blue and
  `3400` for Yellow.
- `RBY-related engine strings` covers engine keys used by original RBY
  gameplay and interfaces.

Engine metrics are informational: unmatched or ambiguous entries keep the
engine's English fallback.

| Target | Red Blue ROM aggregate | Yellow ROM aggregate | RBY-related engine strings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `fr` | 3286/3286 (100%) | 3400/3400 (100%) | 241/241 (100%) |
| `de` | 3286/3286 (100%) | 3400/3400 (100%) | 241/241 (100%) |
| `es` | 3286/3286 (100%) | 3400/3400 (100%) | 241/241 (100%) |
| `it` | 3286/3286 (100%) | 3400/3400 (100%) | 241/241 (100%) |
| `ja-Hrkt` | 3286/3286 (100%) | 3400/3400 (100%) | 241/241 (100%) |

The ROM aggregates exclude extracted labels that do not render visible text.
Reviewed exceptions are recorded in
[`yellow_coverage_exceptions.json`](config/rby/yellow_coverage_exceptions.json).
Full per-key scope, matching strategy and fallback provenance remain available in
the generated coverage report and
[`engine_scope.json`](config/rby/engine_scope.json).

### Gold, Silver and Crystal

Gold and Silver are built as a separate generation-2 artifact. The normal
Simplified Chinese seed build requires no ROM; the multilingual extraction
audit can rebuild from either Gold or Silver and uses Crystal as a companion
ROM. In both paths, Crystal is merged into the same artifact and applied only
on an actual Crystal save:

- `Gold and Silver ROM aggregate` combines dialogue, Pokédex entries and the named ROM
  catalogs. Its denominator excludes 14 markup-only records with no visible
  prose.
- `Gold and Silver-related engine strings` covers the 302 engine keys used by
  at least one production Gen 2 callsite. 48 keys reachable only from a
  Crystal-exclusive feature (Move Tutor, gender selection, the "PokeSeer"/
  Buena's Password radio special, Battle Tower) are excluded from this scope
  -- none of it exists on a real Gold or Silver cart, so it has no PokeCorpus
  row and is not part of what this mod could ever cover; see
  [`config/gsc/engine_scope_exclusions.json`](config/gsc/engine_scope_exclusions.json).
- `Crystal dialogue coverage` is Crystal's own dialogue pointers. Corpus-based
  targets join separately against poke-corpus's own `Crystal/` collection; the
  Simplified Chinese seed resolves its source labels against the pinned public
  linker symbol table (different
  `bank:address` values from Gold/Silver almost throughout, so this is not
  the same catalog as the aggregate above). Its denominator excludes 16
  markup-only records, same convention as the ROM aggregate. This is
  dialogue only for now -- Crystal's own named catalogs (species/moves/
  items/trainer classes) and its 48 Crystal-exclusive engine strings are
  not covered yet; the `Gold and Silver-related engine strings` catalog
  already applies unchanged on a Crystal save (same shared `Strings()`
  code, no separate work needed there). `ko` has no Crystal corpus at all
  in poke-corpus, so its dialogue stays in English.

The generated report retains the dialogue/catalog breakdown and per-key
provenance. Future unresolved entries will keep their original English text.

| Target | Gold and Silver ROM aggregate | Gold and Silver-related engine strings | Crystal dialogue coverage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `fr` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 3994/3994 (100%) |
| `de` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 3994/3994 (100%) |
| `es` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 3994/3994 (100%) |
| `it` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 3994/3994 (100%) |
| `ja-Hrkt` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 3994/3994 (100%) |
| `ko` | 4452/4452 (100%) | 302/302 (100%) | 0/3994 (0%) |

### Other engine strings

The remaining engine keys are reported separately below. They are keys used by
neither RBY nor Gold and Silver, so their denominator is the residual scope:
`1240 - (242 + 302 - 20) = 716`. The numerator counts keys translated in at
least one of the two artifacts; this is a project-level metric, not a claim
that every key is present in both games.

| Target | Other engine strings |
| --- | ---: |
| `fr` | 122/716 (17.04%) |
| `de` | 122/716 (17.04%) |
| `es` | 121/716 (16.9%) |
| `it` | 122/716 (17.04%) |
| `ja-Hrkt` | 117/716 (16.34%) |
| `ko` | 46/716 (6.42%) |

The denominator is calculated as follows: `1240` total engine keys, minus the
`242` RBY-related keys and the `302` Gold and Silver-related keys, plus back the `20` keys
shared by both scopes so they are subtracted only once. The resulting residual
scope is `716` keys.

These values use the pinned ROMs, corpus snapshots and Gen1Recomp revision
`aea38240`; regenerate them whenever one of those inputs changes.

## Translation provenance

Every translated engine string remains traceable:

| Origin | Meaning | Recorded in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic match | Exact, normalized, or structural match proved by the generator. | Generation report |
| Deterministic anchor | Reliable PokeCorpus qid, composition, or extraction rule. | `config/{rby,gs}/semantic_anchors.json` |
| Human-reviewed RBY anchor | Contextual or language-specific extraction reviewed by a maintainer; text still comes from PokeCorpus. | `config/rby/semantic_anchor_decisions.json` |
| Human-reviewed Gold pointer | Ambiguous ROM pointer resolved to a reviewed PokeCorpus qid. | `config/gsc/pointer_decisions.json` |
| Reviewed placeholder exception | Official localized wording legitimately adds or omits a runtime value such as the player name or an item quantity. This records no translated text and does not disable the audit; each exception is scoped to a language, ROM pointer, corpus QID, and exact audit message. | `config/gsc/placeholder_decisions.json` |
| Manual corpus correction | A maintainer corrects one selected-language corpus translation without changing the upstream corpus. Entries are indexed by qid. | `overrides/<language>/rby/corpus.json` |
| Manual translation — engine contract gap | PokeCorpus has the text, but Gen1Recomp merges contexts or hides required parameters. | `overrides/<language>/{rby,gs}/engine.json`, `reason: "engine-contract-gap"` |
| Manual translation — engine original | Engine-specific text with no compatible ROM source. | `overrides/<language>/{rby,gs}/engine.json`, `reason: "engine-original"` |
| Editorial correction | Deliberately preferred engine formulation. | `overrides/<language>/rby/engine.json`, `reason: "editorial-correction"` |
| Manual translation — Yellow-only engine text | Engine-authored, Yellow-exclusive text (Surfing Pikachu minigame HUD) with no PokeCorpus source; applied only when `GameVersion.isYellow()`. | `overrides/<language>/rby/yellow_engine.json`, `reason: "yellow-only-engine-text"` |
| Known limitation | Active anchor/override knowingly imperfect in a context or language; a status, not an origin. | Anchor metadata or override provenance |
| English fallback | No sufficiently reliable translation; runtime keeps English. | Generation report |

Generated coverage reports are the authoritative inventory of unmatched and
ambiguous strings. Every manual override must explain its source and accepted
limitations; otherwise the English fallback is preferred.

## Windows/Linux standalone executables

The GitHub Actions workflow builds CLI and graphical Tkinter executables for
Windows x64 and Linux x86_64:

- `gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator-<version>-<cli|gui>-windows-x64.exe`
- `gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator-<version>-<cli|gui>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

Windows users can run the downloaded EXE directly. Linux builds target Ubuntu
22.04 (glibc) and compatible newer systems; extract the selected archive and
run its binary:

```sh
tar -xzf gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator-<version>-gui-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
chmod +x gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator-<version>-gui-linux-x86_64
./gen1recomp-translation-mod-generator-<version>-gui-linux-x86_64
```

Standalone builds verify their pinned downloads and never bundle or upload
ROMs. The CLI stores its cache in the current directory; the GUI uses the
selected output directory. Keep ROMs and `config/rom_paths.toml` outside the
application bundle.

## Maintainer reference

### Data flow and matching

```text
resolve release -> verify ROMs -> prepare pinned inputs -> extract and match
-> generate -> validate -> inspect and publish archive
```

Text resolution is deterministic:

```text
explicit override > semantic anchor > exact > normalized
> structural placeholder match > empty entry (runtime English fallback)
```

Game-specific configuration lives under `config/rby/` and `config/gsc/`;
language overrides follow the same split under `overrides/<language>/`.

| Configuration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config/rby/engine_scope.json` | RBY coverage classification for engine strings. |
| `config/rby/terminology_anchors.json` | Evidence for corpus terminology used by RBY. |
| `config/rby/literal_handlers.json` | Documented RBY extraction gaps. |
| `config/shared/engine_manifest.json` | Pinned engine revision and complete string universe shared by the releases. |

The semantic anchors and reviewed decisions are described in the
`Translation provenance` section above.
Gold and Silver identify their production strings directly from Gen 2 source subtrees.
Missing or ambiguous evidence always falls back to English. Private review
candidates never become executable configuration automatically.
`strict_engine` requires the engine catalog and scaffold to be present, not
fully translated.

### Module map

| Area | Modules | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry points and policy | `cli.py`, `builder.py`, `gui.py`, `orchestration.py`, `specs.py` | Resolve release requests and dispatch the command, interactive and GUI flows. |
| Inputs and workspace | `project.py`, `dependencies.py`, `rom_paths.py`, `roms.py` | Resolve paths, verify private ROMs and prepare pinned dependencies. |
| Corpus model | `corpus.py`, `model.py`, `align.py`, `worksheet.py`, `tokens.py` | Parse parallel corpora, align qids and preserve control-token contracts. |
| RBY generation | `join.py`, `generate.py`, `literals.py`, `yellow.py`, `yellow_audit.py`, `mod.py` | Join Red/Blue catalogs, build the Yellow layer and emit the universal mod. |
| Gold and Silver generation | `gs_text.py`, `gs_join.py`, `gs_index_join.py`, `gs_engine.py`, `gs_mod.py` | Join GoldSilver to pointer/index catalogs, engine strings and the Gen 2 artifact. |
| Engine strings | `engine.py`, `engine_scope.py` | Match the versioned engine catalog and classify production callsites. |
| Validation and audits | `validate.py`, `disassembly_audit.py`, `engine_backlog.py` | Enforce release gates and produce private diagnostic reports. |

`build_translation.py` is the normal entry point. Intermediate and audit files
stay under `.cache/`.

### Audit commands

Disassembly audit:

```sh
python scripts/pipeline.py audit-disassemblies
```

This writes private comparison reports under `.cache/audit/`. Never publish
them: they can contain copyrighted text and local paths.

Engine backlog:

```sh
python scripts/pipeline.py engine-backlog --language fr
```

This records unresolved keys, callsites, fallback reasons and qid candidates
without modifying anchors, overrides or catalogs. It requires a matching
cached coverage/catalog snapshot.

For all languages (default `fr,de,es,it,ja-Hrkt`):

```sh
python scripts/pipeline.py engine-backlog-matrix
```

This produces the cross-language backlog matrix under
`.cache/audit/engine-backlog/`.

### Release builds

Build standalone artifacts locally with:

```powershell
./packaging/build_windows_executable.ps1
```

```sh
./packaging/build_linux_executable.sh
```

Tag pushes matching `v<version>` validate the version and publish all four
CLI/GUI artifacts. `workflow_dispatch` builds them without publishing. The
workflow compiles pinned LuaJIT, validates both front ends and inspects each
archive before upload.

### Remaining limitations

- Automated gates validate data loading and packaging, not rendering; releases
  still need in-game smoke tests.
- Some engine strings remain in English, as shown by the coverage tables.
- Translated text can exceed fixed UI widths with either font profile.
- The `X ATTACK`/`X DEFENSE`/etc. battle-item and the vitamin (`PROTEIN`,
  `IRON`, `CALCIUM`, `ZINC`, `CARBOS`, `HP UP`) stat-rose messages always
  show the raised stat's name in English: Gen1Recomp substitutes it with a
  raw uppercase value (`stat:upper()`), not through the translated engine
  string catalog. This is different from the SummaryMenu's own stat labels,
  which are fully translated.
- RBY type names are replaced at draw time by exact string match, so a nickname
  identical to an English type name is translated too.
- The desktop launcher uses a separate renderer and is outside the content
  mod's translation hooks.
- RBY- and Gold and Silver-specific upstream engine gaps are tracked in
  [docs/upstream-fixes.md](docs/upstream-fixes.md).
